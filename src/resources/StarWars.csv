"Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back",tt0080684,1980,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BYmU1NDRjNDgtMzhiMi00NjZmLTg5NGItZDNiZjU5NTU4OTE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzkwMjQ5NzM@._V1_SX300.jpg,"<i>The Empire Strikes Back</i> deftly delivers Lucas’s creativity, Kershner’s technical know-how, more rounded characters than its predecessor, and ground-breaking storytelling. And for such, it stands as not only an excellent Star Wars movie and a great sequel, but as one of the best movies ever made."
"Episode IV - A New Hope",tt0076759,1977,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BNzVlY2MwMjktM2E4OS00Y2Y3LWE3ZjctYzhkZGM3YzA1ZWM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzkwMjQ5NzM@._V1_SX300.jpg,"Its influence has made it tame and almost cliche, but despite its age, <i>A New Hope</i> is a masterpiece of storytelling and ingenuity. There should be no question why it was able to impact so many people and so many films."
"Episode VIII - The Last Jedi","Episode VIII - The Last Jedi844",2017,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ1MzcxNjg4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzgwMjY4MzI@._V1_SX300.jpg,"<i>The Last Jedi</i> is perhaps the most thematically resonant of all the Star Wars films. It manages this accolade alongside some genuine surprises, lovely cinematography, and impressive action. Though it is certainly flawed, it makes for a more interesting installment than <i>The Force Awakens</i>."
"Episode VII - The Force Awakens","Episode VII - The Force Awakens844",2015,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BOTAzODEzNDAzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDU1MTgzNzE@._V1_SX300.jpg,"There's no doubt that this movie borrows a lot from its predecessors, but I think the widespread love for this blockbuster flick is a testament to its impressive new characters and its fun and engaging tone."
"Episode III - Revenge of the Sith",tt0121766,2005,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BNTc4MTc3NTQ5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTg0NjI4NA@@._V1_SX300.jpg,"This is the highpoint of the prequels, delivering the emotion and motivation that the previous two lacked."
"Episode VI - Return of the Jedi",tt0086190,1983,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BOWZlMjFiYzgtMTUzNC00Y2IzLTk1NTMtZmNhMTczNTk0ODk1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAyODkwOQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg,"By merit of its final act and its place in the original trilogy, this movie is able to transcend some major disadvantages."
"Solo: A Star Wars Story",tt3778644,2018,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BOTM2NTI3NTc3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzM1OTQyNTM@._V1_SX300.jpg,"Though the humor is lacking and the acting uneven, the propulsive plot is one of the best in the franchise and the movie is still admittedly good."
"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story",tt3748528,2016,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwMzMxODIzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzg3OTAzMDI@._V1_SX300.jpg,"The last act and the fan-fare Vader scene are excellent, but as a whole, the movie is flat and poorly-paced and the characters are unlikable."
"Episode I - The Phantom Menace",tt0120915,1999,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BYTRhNjcwNWQtMGJmMi00NmQyLWE2YzItODVmMTdjNWI0ZDA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAyODkwOQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg,"While the <i>Phantom Menace</i> is certainly flawed, its main asset is its world-building and the sheer creativity at display in Lucas’s plot."
"Episode II - Attack of the Clones",tt0121765,2002,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDAzM2M0Y2UtZjRmZi00MzVlLTg4MjEtOTE3NzU5ZDVlMTU5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDUyOTg3Njg@._V1_.jpg,"This is the lowest point of the franchise, largely due to the flat acting and writing."
