"Beauty and the Beast",tt0101414,1991,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMzE5MDM1NDktY2I0OC00YWI5LTk2NzUtYjczNDczOWQxYjM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg,"The greatest of all the Disney films, <i>Beauty and the Beast</i> captures fairytale magic and all that is enchanting, while still being thrilling and witty. It’s primary characters are complex and its animation—state-of-the-art at the time—is still beautiful and some of Disney’s finest. It also designates sufficient time to developing the love story of its leads, something uncharacteristic of children’s film."
"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs",tt0029583,1937,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTQwMzE2Mzc4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTE4NTc1Nw@@._V1_SX300.jpg,"<i>Snow White</i> could claim this position purely for its animation, dazzling today just as much as it was in 1937. However, it also offers a glimpse into early children’s film and storytelling, displaying the darker possibilities and more nuanced stories that were created in a time forgotten."
"The Lion King",tt0110357,1994,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BYTYxNGMyZTYtMjE3MS00MzNjLWFjNmYtMDk3N2FmM2JiM2M1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjY5NDU4NzI@._V1_SX300.jpg,"It’s amazing to me that Disney took a chance on a semi-original story (something it had almost no experience in). With that chance, they arrived at a beautifully scored and animated film with interesting themes to explore. Moreover, the movie demonstrates some of the best camera movement up to that point in animated film. However, I don’t care for the occasional attempts to lift the mood; it was a good drama as it was. Scar, while despicable and eerie, is not threatening. All-in-all, the <i>Lion King</i> is a great movie with a couple strong scenes (the stampede and death of scar most notably), but it does not establish the mood and epic feel it desired."
Bambi,tt0034492,1942,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTY1NzM4NDg5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjI1MTkzMjE@._V1_SX300.jpg,"This is a great coming-of-age story with well-crafted characters."
"Sleeping Beauty",tt0053285,1959,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BOTJmZjA3MjMtMWNmZS00YTliLWFhMWUtZDU2NGJhNTlmY2ZkL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg,"<i>Sleeping Beauty</i> defines what it means to be a fairytale; everything in the film (especially the world-design) is built toward that purpose."
"The Little Mermaid",tt0097757,1989,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BN2JlZTBhYTEtZDE3OC00NTA3LTk5NTQtNjg5M2RjODllM2M0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjk1Njg5NTA@._V1_SX300.jpg,"Unlike most children’s movies, Disney’s first installment toward their “Renaissance” was a full film with real character development. There are certainly minor flaws, but they pale in the shadow of this giant of a movie."
Frozen,tt2294629,2013,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1MjQwMTE5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk3MTcyMDE@._V1_SX300.jpg,"Though its beginning is too rushed for effectiveness, <i>Frozen</i> is a beautiful, epic fairytale with excellent music and sweet storytelling."
"Mulan ","Mulan 844",1998,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BODkxNGQ1NWYtNzg0Ny00Yjg3LThmZTItMjE2YjhmZTQ0ODY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg,"<i>Mulan</i> offers a good soundtrack and animation, but excels in its humor and villain characterization. It does, however, try too hard at times for laughs."
"The Black Cauldron",tt0088814,1985,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BOTM0N2Q4NjMtZjk2Yy00MmI0LTk2YTItMGQ3NGI5MjU4NzA5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTI4MjkwNjA@._V1_SX300.jpg,"This forgotten gem glimmers on rare occasion with excellent artwork and darker themes. Check out Ebert’s review on this flick."
"The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh",tt0076363,1977,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BNjg5MjQzYTQtMTUzZC00NzlkLTgzZDEtMjg0OWY4NTNjNzJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjI4MjU4MTY@._V1_SX300.jpg,"This Disney classic captures the magic of childhood nostalgia and innocence."
Moana,tt3521164,2016,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjI4MzU5NTExNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzY1MTEwMDI@._V1_SX300.jpg,"Beautifully animated with great music, <i>Moana</i> transcends its cliched story with humor and heart."
Zootopia,tt2948356,2016,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BOTMyMjEyNzIzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzIyNjU0NzE@._V1_SX300.jpg,"Again, Disney delivers an aesthetically brilliant film with more thematic depth than normal."
Pocahontas,tt0114148,1995,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMzc4YzhiN2ItY2Y4NC00YTA0LWEyMjEtNzllNTcxZDdjODhiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTUyMzE4Mzg@._V1_SX300.jpg,"It’s clear that the creative strength behind this movie was blown on its powerful soundtrack and artistic flair and not much else."
Tangled,tt0398286,2010,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTAxNDYxMjg0MjNeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDcyNTk2OTM@._V1_SX300.jpg,"<i>Tangled</i> has a lot of tangible goodness, including one notably creative scene, yet some of the gags and characters feel a little stock."
"Meet the Robinsons",tt0396555,2007,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0NTU4MDY5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzY0MjM0MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg,"This movie moves too quickly but manages funny, engaging characters nonetheless."
Fantasia,tt0032455,1940,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BOGE4ZDQ2YWUtYTIzNi00NTI0LTkxMjQtODBjZjE4NjkxNGI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg,"Though handicapped by its storylessness, <i>Fantasia</i> is undeniably enchanting."
"Lady and the Tramp",tt0048280,1955,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BODk4YWI2MzItYzc2Yi00M2U0LWFhY2MtOTgyODM2NWE0MDcyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg,"Though not much else, this movie offers strong character development."
"Atlantis: The Lost Empire",tt0230011,2001,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BNjM2NzNjMDAtZTAyMi00NTQzLWFlMTctNTUzMGE1ODE2NDRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjY5NDU4NzI@._V1_SX300.jpg,"Not only a grand and epic fantasy, <i>Atlantis</i> boasts likable and dynamic characters."
"Lilo & Stitch",tt0275847,2002,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkwOTU5MTA2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjYyNTc3._V1_SX300.jpg,"<i>Lilo & Stitch</i> crafts a nuanced family dynamic alongside above-average animation."
Tarzan,tt0120855,1999,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BY2ZiYWUxN2ItYmQxZi00NDlkLWE2NDAtOTNmYTg1MDI0NDk1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUwNzk3NDc@._V1_SX300.jpg,"This movie has a lot going for it—artistic strength, good music, easy pacing—but it never transcends, never becoming a great movie."
"Robin Hood",tt0070608,1973,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BYjUwMzhkM2ItMTU2OC00OTQ5LWJlMDUtMzRmYjc0NDUyNGVhL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg,"Sweet, folksy, and simple, this movie—like <i>The Adventures of Winnie the Pooh</i>—captures nostalgia and whimsy. However, it does suffer from a hurried story and sub-par animation."
"The Hunchback of Notre Dame",tt0116583,1996,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BNzMxMDc4OGItODBiZi00NjYyLThiMzctMzQwZjgzYWE0MzQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTUyMzE4Mzg@._V1_SX300.jpg,"I have mixed feelings on this movie. It is often very dark and, for that reason, very powerful. It also has many dazzling visuals, but the animation could have been so much more; it often seems hollow or lacking up-close. I guess there is nothing wrong with making the dark source material into a happy ending like all the other Disney films since they are children entertainment, but my big problem is the movie’s theme of physical appearance not mattering (much like the theme from <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>). This is arguably the main theme of the movie in the midst of other dark subjects, and this main theme is ruined. Quasimodo is made less repulsive with a young voice and repeated songs trivializing his deformity. To boot, at the end, he isn’t even hesitant about losing the girl to the knight in shining armor. Some other slight complaints are that it, like other Disney movies, tries to lighten the mood in inappropriate places, and that it (and I care even less about this) steals from previous Disney movies—e.g. plot, characters, scenes, etc."
Aladdin,tt0103639,1992,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BY2Q2NDI1MjUtM2Q5ZS00MTFlLWJiYWEtNTZmNjQ3OGJkZDgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTI4MjkwNjA@._V1_SX300.jpg,"This movie dropped a lot for me with a more recent viewing. While the Genie character is strong and the climax excellent, it has little in the way of propulsion."
"Big Hero 6",tt2245084,2014,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMDliOTIzNmUtOTllOC00NDU3LWFiNjYtMGM0NDc1YTMxNjYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTM3NzExMDQ@._V1_SX300.jpg,"Though it is beautifully animated with an exciting second half, its pacing is too quick and it feels like it's just hitting the beats."
"The Fox and the Hound",tt0082406,1981,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMDQzZWRlYjctMjE0ZS00NWU5LWE3NzktYzZiNzJiM2UxMDczXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUwNzk3NDc@._V1_SX300.jpg,"It offers a meaningful story through a great ending, but as a Disney musical, it falls flat."
Pinocchio,tt0032910,1940,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4Mzk3ODIyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODgyNzk2NjE@._V1_SX300.jpg,"This classic has fun songs, good animation (though not as good as its predecessor), and a certain depth, but its themes are too on the nose and its pacing uneven."
"The Rescuers Down Under",tt0100477,1990,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BNjY1OWZkMjQtMDY0YS00ZGRiLTg1YjktMzlmZWQyZWMzZGI1L2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg,"Distractingly implausible and inconsistent, this movie still demonstrates solid effects and a menacing villain."
"The Emperor's New Groove",tt0120917,2000,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BNzk1ZDcwY2YtMzRhZi00OTYwLTkzMmYtMGMwN2Y3ZjM1MTM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTUyMzE4Mzg@._V1_SX300.jpg,"Truly fun with an excellent moral shift, <i>The Emperor’s New Groove</i> is a good movie lowered only by its poor animation and inability to compete with better films."
"Fantasia 2000",tt0120910,1999,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTE3OGUxNmItZmM3MC00ZTI3LTg0YTUtMzA3MGJkZjkyNjEyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg,"Enchanting like its forerunner, this movie is solid despite its poor use of CGI."
"Oliver & Company",tt0095776,1988,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTI5NTE2OTQtN2YyZi00OTI5LTljMmEtMDZlMTk0MzNmZmY5L2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg,"This Disney movie acts as our point of inflection for quality. It boasts the musical talent of Billy Joel with a few flashes of quality animation, yet it offers no closure and the graphics are overwhelmingly bad."
"101 Dalmatians",tt0055254,1961,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BZGMyMjE4OGUtNGZmMC00YzdmLThkMWYtZWIzMmEzNjA4MzVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg,"While the villain is cinematically interesting, the movie is anti-climatic."

Hercules,tt0119282,1997,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BZDcwYjEyNWItMGI1Mi00MjI1LWIyMDEtMTQ4YjhkNjM4NDU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDUyOTg3Njg@._V1_SX300.jpg,"While the movie is entertaining and genuinely funny, the chosen style of animation is distractingly distasteful and the plotting is far too fast."
"The Princess and the Frog",tt0780521,2009,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyOTQ5NzAzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTcyNTU1Mg@@._V1_SX300.jpg,"The thematic exploration is one of Disney’s best, as is the style and villain of the film, but in the end, the movie is too contrived and not patient with its own development."
"The Jungle Book",tt0061852,1967,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwMTExODExNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjM2MDgyMTE@._V1_SX300.jpg,"It can be really fun at times, but it too suffers from rushed storytelling and character you never grow to care for."

"Treasure Planet",tt0133240,2002,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0NDg3MjU2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODgyMDg5._V1_SX300.jpg,"The animation is pretty and the villain surprisingly complex, but the CGI has badly dated the movie."
