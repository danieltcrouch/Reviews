"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs",tt0029583,1937,9,"Snow White could claim this score purely for its animation, dazzling today just as much as it was in 1937. However, it also offers a glimpse into early children’s film and storytelling, displaying the darker possibilities and more nuanced stories that were created in a time forgotten."
"The Wizard of Oz",tt0032138,1939,7,"Whenever I got into film criticism, I had a hard time understanding the Wizard of Oz's place in the American film canon. I remember reading Otis Ferguson's review of the movie, the early and only detractor to the film's greatness, and sympathizing with all of this witty criticism. However, later I stumbled across Roger Ebert's review of the film, and it changed everything for me. I recommend everyone check out Ebert's review. It persuaded me. Judy's voice, the 30s Hollywood effects, the silliness... Dorthy opening that door."
"Gulliver's Travels",tt0031397,1939,7,"Not quite Snow White, but an excellent way to start the genre."
Pinocchio,tt0032910,1940,7,"This classic has fun songs, good animation (though not as good as its predecessor), and a certain depth, but its themes are too on the nose and its pacing uneven."
Dumbo,tt0033563,1941,5,"While one of its scenes is exceptionally potent, the rest is strange and distancing."
Bambi,tt0034492,1942,9,"Bambi is a beautiful piece from another time."
Cinderella,tt0042332,1950,7,"It’s sweet but too hurried for any real attachment."
"Alice in Wonderland",tt0043274,1951,7,"Psychologically interesting for its nonsensical elements—and at times even sweet—Alice in Wonderland is still strange and distant."
"Duck Amuck",tt0045708,1953,8,***
"Sleeping Beauty",tt0053285,1959,9,"Sleeping Beauty defines what it means to be a fairytale; everything in the film (especially the world-design) is built toward that purpose."
"Mary Poppins",tt0058331,1964,8,***
"How the Grinch Stole Christmas!",tt0060345,1966,7,***
"The Jungle Book",tt0061852,1967,7,"It can be really fun at times, but it too suffers from rushed storytelling and character you never grow to care for."
"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory",tt0067992,1971,9,"1971's Willy Wonka, besides being a haven of nostalgia for thousands, is a movie crafted for whimsy and grace, a style almost forgotten in modern cinema"
"Robin Hood",tt0070608,1973,8,"Sweet, folksy, and simple, this movie—like The Adventures of Winnie the Pooh—captures nostalgia and whimsy. However, it does suffer from a hurried story and sub-par animation."
"The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh",tt0076363,1977,8,"This Disney classic captures the magic of childhood nostalgia and innocence."
"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope",tt0076759,1977,9,"Its influence has made it tame and almost cliche, but despite its age, A New Hope is a masterpiece of storytelling and ingenuity. There should be no question why it was able to impact so many people and so many films."
"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back",tt0080684,1980,9,"The Empire Strikes Back deftly delivers Lucas’s creativity, Kershner’s technical know-how, more rounded characters than its predecessor, and ground-breaking storytelling. And for such, it stands as not only an excellent Star Wars movie and a great sequel, but as one of the best movies ever made."
"Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi",tt0086190,1983,8,"By merit of its final act and its place in the original trilogy, this movie is able to transcend some major disadvantages."
"A Christmas Carol",tt0087056,1984,8,***
"¡Three Amigos!",tt0092086,1986,8,***
"The Land Before Time",tt0095489,1988,7,***
"The Little Mermaid",tt0097757,1989,9,"The Little Mermaid, though introducing a thematically dubious structure to children's film, revitalized the genre and is the foundation for countless masterpieces afterward."
"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids",tt0097523,1989,7,***
"DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp",tt0099472,1990,7,***
"The Rescuers Down Under",tt0100477,1990,7,"Distractingly inconsistent, this movie still demonstrates solid effects and a menacing villain."
"Home Alone",tt0099785,1990,7,***
"Beauty and the Beast",tt0101414,1991,10,"The greatest of all the Disney films, Beauty and the Beast captures fairytale magic and all that is enchanting, while still being thrilling and witty. It’s primary characters are complex and its animation—state-of-the-art at the time—is still beautiful and some of Disney’s finest. It also designates sufficient time to developing the love story of its leads, something uncharacteristic of children’s film."
Aladdin,tt0103639,1992,7,"This movie dropped a lot for me with a more recent viewing. While the Genie character is strong and the climax excellent, it has little in the way of propulsion."
"Home Alone 2: Lost in New York",tt0104431,1992,6,***
"The Lion King",tt0110357,1994,9,"It’s amazing to me that Disney took a chance on a semi-original story (something it had almost no experience in). With that chance, they arrived at a beautifully scored and animated film with interesting themes to explore. Moreover, the movie demonstrates some of the best camera movement up to that point in animated film. However, I don’t care for the occasional attempts to lift the mood; it was a good drama as it was. Scar, while despicable and eerie, is not threatening. All-in-all, the Lion King is a great movie with a couple strong scenes (the stampede and death of scar most notably), but it does not establish the mood and epic feel it desired."
"The Swan Princess",tt0111333,1994,6,***
"The Jungle Book",tt0110213,1994,7,***
"101 Dalmatians",tt0115433,1996,6,***
"Men in Black",tt0119654,1997,8,"Funny and intense, it's no secret why this movie occupied such a prominent position in culture"
"Batman & Robin",tt0118688,1997,5,***
Mulan,tt0120762,1998,8,"Mulan offers a good soundtrack and animation, but excels in its humor and villain characterization. It does, however, try too hard at times for laughs."
"The Prince of Egypt",tt0120794,1998,9,***
"A Bug's Life",tt0120623,1998,8,***
"The Mask of Zorro",tt0120746,1998,7,***

"Mighty Joe Young",tt0120751,1998,7,***
"Doctor Dolittle",tt0061584,1967,7,***
"Doctor Dolittle",tt0118998,1998,5,***
"Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace",tt0120915,1999,7,"While the Phantom Menace is certainly flawed, its main asset is its world-building and the sheer creativity at display in Lucas’s plot."
"The Mummy",tt0120616,1999,7,"A much needed adaption for a classic horror film."
"The Iron Giant",tt0129167,1999,10,"The Iron Giant is the most thematically cohesive and powerful children's movie ever made."
"Toy Story 2",tt0120363,1999,9,***
Tarzan,tt0120855,1999,8,"This movie has a lot going for it—artistic strength, good music, easy pacing—but it never transcends, never becoming a great movie."
"The Sixth Sense",tt0167404,1999,9,"The Sixth Sense, though not the first movie with a twist, is maybe the best movie with a twist. It launched multiple careers and affected the industry for years to come."
"Inspector Gadget",tt0141369,1999,3,***
Fantasia,tt0032455,1940,8,"Though handicapped by its storylessness, Fantasia is undeniably enchanting."
"It's a Wonderful Life",tt0038650,1946,10,"Though sometimes pigeonholed as a holiday classic, It's a Wonderful Life should not be dismissed. It is a heartwarming tale whose message holds truth both for individuals and for societal values."
"Make Mine Music",tt0038718,1946,6,"This is little more than cute stories with fun music."
"Fun & Fancy Free",tt0039404,1947,7,"These miniature stories are good for what they are."
"The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad",tt0041094,1949,6,"These are great stories with no character development."
"All About Eve",tt0042192,1950,9,"A fascinating story of a manipulative actress's rise to power. You'll love to hate her by the end."
"Roman Holiday",tt0046250,1953,7,"Excellent Romantic Comedy—many of the modern attempts could learn something from this movie."
"Peter Pan",tt0046183,1953,7,"The characters are eccentric and therefore fun, but the movie lacks heart (and likable protagonists)."
"Lady and the Tramp",tt0048280,1955,8,"Though not much else, this movie offers strong character development."
"The Searchers",tt0049730,1956,10,"Westerns have a history of simplification and, for a long time, needed a more thorough tackling of the genre. That is why John Ford's darker undertaking starring the Duke, himself, is both a relief and the greatest revisioning of the heart of Westerns."
"The Ten Commandments",tt0049833,1956,9,"If you watch this in the 1956 mindset, then it will be one of the most beautiful movies you've ever seen. Each shot of DeMille's masterpiece is framed with thought and elegance."
"The Bad Seed",tt0048977,1956,7,***
"12 Angry Men",tt0050083,1957,10,"Twelve Angry Men has assumed a pop-position as a universally loved film classic. ""Everyone loves Twelve Angry Men,"" they say. Its tight script, stirring acting, and novel setting makes for a movie everyone can enjoy. And that's all right with me. Though the uppity critic within me doubts that the average audience appreciates everything this movie does right, I hope to expel that attitude since I love having a film that everyone can agree on. Twelve Angry Men has filled the role, perfectly, of an introductory movie to show people the magic of classic cinema—something we should all be grateful for."
"Remember the Titans",tt0210945,2000,8,***
"The Emperor's New Groove",tt0120917,2000,7,"Truly fun with an excellent moral shift, The Emperor’s New Groove is a good movie lowered only by its poor animation and inability to compete with better films."
"The Lion King 2: Simba's Pride",tt0120131,1998,6,***
"Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas",tt0118692,1997,6,***
"Aladdin and the King of Thieves",tt0115491,1996,6,***
Dinosaur,tt0130623,2000,6,"It’s pretty but cliche."
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?",tt0190590,2000,9,"The Coen Brothers demonstrate their wide-ranging abilities in this cultural touchstone."
"How the Grinch Stole Christmas",tt0170016,2000,7,***
"The Magic Sword: Quest for Camelot",tt0120800,1998,4,***
Spartacus,tt0054331,1960,9,***
Cinderfella,tt0053716,1960,7,***
"101 Dalmatians",tt0055254,1961,7,"While the villain is cinematically interesting, the movie is anti-climatic."
"The Birds",tt0056869,1963,7,***
"The Sword in the Stone",tt0057546,1963,5,"Nothing ever happens. Maybe it'd work as a post-modern film?"
"The Sound of Music",tt0059742,1965,9,"The Sound of Music is the perfect balance between war and family drama and uplifting musical"
"Fahrenheit 451",tt0060390,1966,7,***
"Planet of the Apes",tt0063442,1968,8,***
Jaws,tt0073195,1975,9,***
"Monty Python and the Holy Grail",tt0071853,1975,9,"Witty yet silly, The Holy Grail is a timelessly quotable comedy."
"The Rescuers",tt0076618,1977,5,"This is the worst of all the Disney Classics."
"Escape to Witch Mountain",tt0072951,1975,6,***
"Pete's Dragon",tt0076538,1977,6,***
"The Brave Little Toaster",tt0092695,1987,7,***
"Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey",tt0107131,1993,6,***
Shrek,tt0126029,2001,8,"It set many precedents and is probably the funniest animated films out there"
Halloweentown,tt0173886,1998,6,***
"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring",tt0120737,2001,9,"J. R. R. Tolkien's original Lord of the Rings Trilogy was very different from Jackson's adaptations. They were fairytales about quest-timid Hobbits exploring the world, having amazing yet terrifying adventures on their way to Mt. Doom. Jackson's Fellowship of the Ring is much darker than its source. There is burden and turmoil of the soul, and constant violence. This definitely speaks to our times and the environment in which this movie was produced, but more so, it is (while different) a masterful portrayal of the original series. And I'll add: it could be more of what Tolkien desired had he not been writing in the lingering Romantic era of literature. And don't let the length perturb you; Jackson is retelling a beautiful story, not butchering the story as many directors have done before. His intro to the LOTR series has reintroduced the epic and fantasy to modern cinema with unparalleled power and grace."
"Atlantis: The Lost Empire",tt0230011,2001,8,"Not only a grand and epic fantasy, Atlantis boasts likable and dynamic characters."
"Jurassic Park III",tt0163025,2001,6,***
"Osmosis Jones",tt0181739,2001,6,"The premise is incredibly creative but the execution lacking"
"Monsters, Inc.",tt0198781,2001,8,***
"The Others",tt0230600,2001,8,***
"Planet of the Apes",tt0133152,2001,5,***
"The Mummy Returns",tt0209163,2001,6,"Though a lacking sequel to a middling movie, The Mummy Returns most stands out for helping introduce the world to the acting talents of the Rock"
Airplane!,tt0080339,1980,9,"Airplane is exceptionally witty and well-written."
"Raiders of the Lost Ark",tt0082971,1981,10,"The Indiana Jones series is, admittedly, not a deep one. It doesn't deal with Catholic guilt or wrestle with the problem of pain. However, the Spielberg and Lucas collaboration demonstrates the finest of movie-making magic. From start to finish, each film is a heart-pounding, laugh-inducing, technically-triumphant romp; they are fun, humorous, and at times even sweet. And as a story told perfectly—with characters that matter and clearly understood motivations—Raiders of the Lost Ark represents the best of the series and a movie we will not soon forget as we remember back to Dr. Jones's fear of snakes,  unconventional tactics in a knife-fight, and all of his exciting adventures."
"The Fox and the Hound",tt0082406,1981,7,"It offers a meaningful story through a great ending, but as a Disney musical, it falls flat."
"Airplane II: The Sequel",tt0083530,1982,6,***
"The Secret of NIMH",tt0084649,1982,8,***
"E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial",tt0083866,1982,8,"Though I didn't grow up with the warm feelings surrounding this movie that the generation before me did, I still recognize ET as a delightful and inspiring entry from the great Spielberg"
"Mickey's Christmas Carol",tt0085936,1983,8,***
"The Terminator",tt0088247,1984,8,"In spite of the Tomatometer, I'll have to say T2 is the better film. That aside, this movie is strong, intense, scary, and exciting. Great movie."
"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom",tt0087469,1984,8,"Again, a super funny movie that quickly gets you engaged and keeps you interested. A great sequel for a classic series."
Ghostbusters,tt0087332,1984,8,"Typical of the 80s style—humorous but not clearly a comedy, inventive and narratively strong—Ghostbusters stands out as a clear classic"
"Back to the Future",tt0088763,1985,10,"There is so much to be learned from this near-perfect movie—how to build a franchise and set-p sequels, how to write a propulsive narrative, how to develop characters in a meaningful way, how to use a score effectively, how to create natural set-ups and pay-offs. Back to the Future is so tightly written and executed, it's hard to find anything wrong with it."
"The Great Mouse Detective",tt0091149,1986,6,"The premise is fun, but the movie doesn’t do enough to build upon that premise."
"Ferris Bueller's Day Off",tt0091042,1986,8,***
"Top Gun",tt0092099,1986,6,***
"The Princess Bride",tt0093779,1987,8,***
"Planes, Trains & Automobiles",tt0093748,1987,8,***
"Oliver & Company",tt0095776,1988,7,"This Disney movie acts as our point of inflection for quality. It boasts the musical talent of Billy Joel with a few flashes of quality animation, yet it offers no closure and the graphics are overwhelmingly bad."
"Who Framed Roger Rabbit",tt0096438,1988,8,"This a very fun movie to watch and even works as an interesting noir flick."
"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade",tt0097576,1989,9,***
"Field of Dreams",tt0097351,1989,7,***
"Back to the Future Part II",tt0096874,1989,8,***
"Ghostbusters II",tt0097428,1989,6,***
"Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones",tt0121765,2002,6,"This is the lowest point of the franchise, largely due to the flat acting and writing."
"The Ring",tt0298130,2002,8,"The Ring stands as one of the best US horror films of the decade"
Spider-Man,tt0145487,2002,8,***
"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers",tt0167261,2002,9,"As was hinted in the previous film, Jackson has taken his own direction with Tolkien's fantasy. He has made the fate of the character Aragorn the primary focus of the movie rather than Frodo's quest. And there is certainly no whimsy in this film as was still faintly present in the last. The Two Towers has lost some of the darker elements of the last film (on the other hand, a bit more psychological depth has been introduced via the character Gollum), but has further embraced its epic feel. Also, The Two Towers contained quite possibly the greatest mass battle scene ever filmed."
"Lilo & Stitch",tt0275847,2002,8,"Lilo & Stitch crafts a nuanced family dynamic alongside above-average animation."
"Die Another Day",tt0246460,2002,6,***
"Reign of Fire",tt0253556,2002,6,***
RocketMan,tt0120029,1997,5,***
"Ice Age",tt0268380,2002,8,"This is a fun, enjoyable quest film."
"John Q",tt0251160,2002,5,"This movie, while heavy-handed, enjoys the benefit of Washington's talent"
Signs,tt0286106,2002,9,***

"Back to the Future Part III",tt0099088,1990,7,***
"Terminator 2",tt0103064,1991,10,"Boasting Schwarzenegger's best performance to date and Robert Patrick as the chilling T-1000, Terminator 2: Judgment Day is one of the best sequels ever made—or movie, for that matter."
"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves",tt0102798,1991,6,"It's got some camp to it, but as a whole, the tone was a little confusing. Still, I was very entertained, especially by Rickman."
Hook,tt0102057,1991,6,"For a children's audience, this is a fantastic film—whimsical and sweet. For adults, on the other hand, it is good, but it doesn't quite capture the magic that other films have."
"The Rocketeer",tt0102803,1991,7,***
"The Mighty Ducks",tt0104868,1992,6,"It's a children's movie, made for kids about kids—classic to the disney formula."
"The Sandlot",tt0108037,1993,8,"Calibrated for maximum nostalgia, it is hard not to enjoy The Sandlot"
"Groundhog Day",tt0107048,1993,8,"Groundhog Day is more than a funny outing or a neat premise but a well-executed narrative on character change"
"Jurassic Park",tt0107290,1993,10,"Though most of the screen time is filled with cold-blooded dinosaurs, this movie is really a heartwarming tale of old birds. Moreover, the film has wit, thrills, and suspense—few movies can compete with this sci-fi, action hit."
"Batman: Mask Of The Phantasm",tt0106364,1993,9,***
"Demolition Man",tt0106697,1993,6,"This movie excels at its creative world-building"

"Dumb and Dumber",tt0109686,1994,8,***
"Forrest Gump",tt0109830,1994,9,"Certainly, it has some oversimplifications, but it is no doubt a heartwarming and hilarious story. And though it may be ""simple,"" it has profound lessons to teach in the most endearing of ways."
"D2: The Mighty Ducks",tt0109520,1994,5,"Fun for children, though generally the same as the first."
X-Men,tt0120903,2000,7,***
Braveheart,tt0112573,1995,8,***
"Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls",tt0112281,1995,6,"A fairly funny movie with Jim Carey almost parodying himself"
Pocahontas,tt0114148,1995,8,"It’s clear that the creative strength behind this movie was blown on its powerful soundtrack and artistic flair and not much else."
Jumanji,tt0113497,1995,8,***

"Bruce Almighty",tt0315327,2003,7,***
"School of Rock",tt0332379,2003,7,"Providing the archetypal movie for Jack Black's work, School of Rock is funny, quotable, and full of heart"
"X-Men 2",tt0290334,2003,8,"X2: X-Men United, despite its originally silly title, stands as one of the best superhero films to-date. It provides the style and action necessary for any hero flick, but also delivers one of the more intimate stories through its inner circle of characters."
"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl",tt0325980,2003,8,***
"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King",tt0167260,2003,8,"The final film is epic and grand, but not terribly profound; it is a great conclusion to a great series. There is closure and judgment distributed. As a wonderful cap to the trilogy, it is thus an amazing movie. But it is probably the weakest of the three films, lacking great character development or as stunning (though still stunning) action as the previous movie."
"The Hunchback of Notre Dame",tt0116583,1996,8,"I have mixed feelings on this movie. It is often very dark and, for that reason, very powerful. It also has many dazzling visuals, but the animation could have been so much more; it often seems hollow or lacking up-close."

"The Spanish Prisoner",tt0120176,1997,8,"This movie is a family favorite and an intriguing mystery"
Hercules,tt0119282,1997,7,"While the movie is entertaining and genuinely funny, the chosen style of animation is distractingly distasteful and the plotting is far too fast."

Anastasia,tt0118617,1997,8,***
"The Matrix",tt0133093,1999,9,"This is, yet again, another revolutionary film whose industry altering effects can be felt in any casual viewing. "
"Fantasia 2000",tt0120910,1999,7,"Enchanting like its forerunner, this movie is solid despite its poor use of CGI."
"Galaxy Quest",tt0177789,1999,8,"Very funny and full of heart"

"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen",tt0311429,2003,6,***
Hulk,tt0286716,2003,7,"Though tonally flawed to its core, the Hulk is a fascinating movie and in some ways the most intellectual installment in the superhero genre"
"The Elephant Man",tt0080678,1980,8,***
Gladiator,tt0172495,2000,8,"At best, this movie is morally confused. Still, some parts are moving, and others are certainly thrilling."
"Dude, Where's My Car?",tt0242423,2000,6,***
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon",tt0190332,2000,9,"A beautiful tragedy that one can only hope will influence American filmmaking"
"A Knight's Tale",tt0183790,2001,8,"A stylized film built on the likability and charisma of its leads"
Zoolander,tt0196229,2001,8,"Witty and silly at the same time, Zoolander is a comedic classic of the early 2000s."
"A Walk to Remember",tt0281358,2002,7,***
"The Count of Monte Cristo",tt0245844,2002,8,"The movie is solid but coasts mainly on the merit of the source material"

"50 First Dates",tt0343660,2004,3,***
"The Polar Express",tt0338348,2004,7,"It is the most regal and mystical of all the Christmas classics."
"Spider-Man 2",tt0316654,2004,9,"Though not as funny as its MCU descendants, SM2 demonstrates the best of artistic blockbusters. Raimi, a master of horror and genre-conflation, uses all his technical skill to provide a thrilling movie, but he also brings to life real characters, dealing with real, human situations."
"King Arthur",tt0349683,2004,6,***
"The Incredibles",tt0317705,2004,10,"Though the competition is stiff with some of my personal favorites, The Incredibles is perhaps the best superhero film to date, boasting witty humor and true emotion."

"Gone With the Wind",tt0031381,1939,7,"I need to give this classic a second viewing. When I saw it years ago, I was not particularly impressed but mildly entertained."

"For a Few Dollars More",tt0059578,1965,8,***
"Hang 'Em High",tt0061747,1968,8,"A strong follow-up to an impossible movie to follow up, 66's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"

Casablanca,tt0034583,1942,8,"This movie gets better with every viewing"
"Beauty and the Beast",tt0038348,1946,7,"I do believe that movies have bettered with time, but this movie shows genuine emotion and dazzling effects."

"Rio Bravo",tt0053221,1959,9,"Westerns have a reputation for poor, simple plots and flat characters, but this movie defies all that. Rio Bravo has an engaging story with sympathetic characters and suspenseful scenes."
"North by Northwest",tt0053125,1959,7,"While certainly good, I have mixed feelings concerning the ending"
Psycho,tt0054215,1960,9,***
"To Kill A Mockingbird",tt0056592,1962,8,"Definitely has some oversimplification, but still a great movie."
"Lawrence of Arabia",tt0056172,1962,10,"A wonder of cinematic beauty and grandeur, this move—in parts—may seem to be little more than a power-corrupts film, but Peter O'Toole's unique and sensual performance makes it so much more."
"Cape Fear",tt0055824,1962,8,"Thrilling and suspenseful"

"Doctor Zhivago",tt0059113,1965,7,***

Camelot,tt1672189,1967,7,***
"The Dirty Dozen",tt0061578,1967,9,"This is a perfectly emotional anti-hero film."

Hitch,tt0386588,2005,7,***

"King Kong",tt0360717,2005,8,***
"War of the Worlds",tt0407304,2005,7,"Created during Spielberg's plunge into darker filmmaking, War of the Worlds is good but most interesting as a case-study"
"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory",tt0367594,2005,4,"It will never compare to the Original. Never."
"Red Eye",tt0421239,2005,7,"I could do without the very end, but this movie is a top-notch thriller."
"Batman Begins",tt0372784,2005,8,"A revolutionary film as far as superheroes are concerned; the original gritty superhero movie. Nolan forever changed the industry by deciding to take the genre seriously."

Gandhi,tt0083987,1982,9,"This is a moving, powerful epic about one of the most important figures in history—well worth every second of its 3h 11m runtime"
Scarface,tt0086250,1983,9,"More edgy than the Godfathers, it can easily stand on the same plane as a Gangster epic."
WarGames,tt0086567,1983,6,***
"Rocky IV",tt0089927,1985,7,"Everyone knows this is the best Rocky film. ""I will break you."" Classic."

"Vision Quest",tt0090270,1985,2,"Vision Quest doesn't do a lot right, and it makes plenty of strange choices as a movie"

Batman,tt0096895,1989,6,"This movie demonstrates how fascinating the Joker character can be"

"Schindler's List",tt0108052,1993,10,"Possibly the greatest work by the greatest director makes Schindler's List possibly the greatest film of all time. Both heart wrenching and optimistic, this movie handles its delicate subject with complete care and aptitude. "

"The Shawshank Redemption",tt0111161,1994,9,"A simply beautiful and moving story"
Se7en,tt0114369,1995,9,"An intense movie with powerful performances, Se7en is another success for David Fincher. It is not necessarily thought-provoking, but is without a doubt a film that has more to offer than thrills."
GoldenEye,tt0113189,1995,8,"This is another example of my biased opinion, having grown up watching and loving this movie. But regardless, I see the campy yet thrilling Bond Series that I love at its finest."
Casino,tt0112641,1995,8,"Sam sets this movie apart from other gangster and Scorsese films by being a legitimately likable character."
"Batman Forever",tt0112462,1995,6,***
"Billy Madison",tt0112508,1995,6,"One of Sandler's early hits, this movie takes an easy-but-still-interesting premise and squeezes quality jokes from it"
"Romeo + Juliet",tt0117509,1996,8,"The beginning is wonderfully intense, and the source material certainly helps with the film's success."
"Happy Gilmore",tt0116483,1996,6,"Another of Sandler's early hits, this movie isn't special but it does deliver on occasional humor"
Titanic,tt0120338,1997,7,***
"Good Will Hunting",tt0119217,1997,9,"While I admire the filmmaking (and the music is particularly delightful given the year), this movie stands on the power of its humanity."

"The Green Mile",tt0120689,1999,8,***
"The World Is Not Enough",tt0143145,1999,6,"This movie exists somewhere along the Brosnan-spectrum of Goldeneye (and its realism) and Die Another Day (and its campiness). In the middle is not a good place to be."
"Office Space",tt0151804,1999,9,"Exceptionally witty"

"Nacho Libre",tt0457510,2006,8,***
"Martian Child",tt0415965,2007,1,"The reasons for my hatred of this movie are long, complex, and personal. But in short, it is a forced movie with little heart."

"License to Wed",tt0762114,2007,5,***
Ratatouille,tt0382932,2007,9,"This is one of my personal favorite Pixar movies. It has many of the usual strengths of that studio, but it also manages to capture the experience of taste in a purely visual medium—something for which it receives full marks."
"Wild Hogs",tt0486946,2007,3,***
"Evan Almighty",tt0413099,2007,4,"Despite the wit of its lead actor, this movie fails to capture the humor of its predecessor"
"The Bourne Ultimatum",tt0440963,2007,8,***
"Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer",tt0486576,2007,2,"This sequel offers little reason for existing beyond its mildly-more entertaining predecessor"
Snatch,tt0208092,2000,9,***
Memento,tt0209144,2000,9,"An excellent precursor to the career of one of the great modern directors"
Unbreakable,tt0217869,2000,9,"Though I may be biased as a lover of comicbooks, Unbreakable stands as one of Shyamalan's early feats."
"Ocean's Eleven",tt0240772,2001,10,"To the best of my knowledge, there is only one thing cooler than George Clooney, and that's Brad Pitt. So for a movie starring both of them—and with Matt Damon and Don Cheadle to boot—Ocean's Eleven easily stands as the coolest, wittiest, most stylish, most suspenseful heist film out there."
"Black Hawk Down",tt0265086,2001,4,"I couldn't keep up with the characters. I hear it is really good, though. I'll give it another chance soon enough."

Troy,tt0332452,2004,8,"I'm a little biased, but I really like this movie. It's a terrific Epic based on a terrific epic. What it wants to do—which is entertain me—it does really well."
"Million Dollar Baby",tt0405159,2004,6,***
"The Punisher",tt0330793,2004,7,"It's depressing and violent, and it lacks a thematic/artistic taste to lift it above its flaws. Still, the characters seem interesting enough and there is a glimmer of creativity in the ""by-the-numbers revenge."""
"Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story",tt0364725,2004,7,***
"A Series of Unfortunate Events",tt0339291,2004,6,***
"Napoleon Dynamite",tt0374900,2004,9,"Napolean Dynamite was a truly inventive film that revolutionized the comedy-drama for the next decade, and in some ways, ushered in the current age of independent movie-making."
"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull",tt0367882,2008,7,"Harrison Ford is great and the movie is a lot of fun."
"Iron Man",tt0371746,2008,9,"Iron Man is significantly more tame than the most recent franchise installments, and by its smaller scope, it delivers one of the most personal stories in the universe. The movie is also noteworthy purely for its cinematic influence, not only for establishing the summer tentpole genre for the next decade but also for demonstrating the power of casting."
"The Dark Knight",tt0468569,2008,9,"Presently my favorite superhero movie. With snazzy moral dilemmas and a wonderful performance by Ledger, you can easily get over Maggie Gyllenhaal."
Hancock,tt0448157,2008,6,***

Cloverfield,tt1060277,2008,8,***
Twilight,tt1099212,2008,7,"This subpar movie excels only in cultural importance and in its soundtrack"
"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button",tt0421715,2008,8,"The most intriguing part is how they handle everyone's greatest fear: to grow weak, ugly, and old—they take the infamously handsome Brad Pitt and watch as he becomes stronger, younger, and more beautiful."
Taken,tt0936501,2008,6,***
300,tt0416449,2006,8,"This movie is exciting and visually thrilling, and has narrative strength as well. I don't think this is the greatest movie of the year, but it is certainly more than pulp film."

"The Illusionist",tt0443543,2006,8,***
"The Prestige",tt0482571,2006,9,"Suspenseful and beautifully shot, The Prestige acts as a great showcase for the abilities of its two leads."

Zombieland,tt1156398,2009,8,***
"Sherlock Holmes",tt0988045,2009,8,"As no loyalist to the books, Sherlock Holmes is a serviceable mystery with plenty of Ritchie's flair"

"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen",tt1055369,2009,5,***
"The Princess and the Frog",tt0780521,2009,7,"The thematic exploration is one of Disney’s best, as is the style and villain of the film, but in the end, the movie is too contrived and not patient with its own development."
"The Invention of Lying",tt1058017,2009,3,"The first rule of being a comedy is being funny. This movie tries too hard to push its message (one I obviously dislike) and too little on being funny"

"District 9",tt1136608,2009,7,***
"500 Days of Summer",tt1022603,2009,8,"There is a lot wrong with this movie, but also a lot that Webb and the writers got right. One of the best romance movies ever and very possibly the best romantic comedy."

"X-Men Origins: Wolverine",tt0458525,2009,3,***

Avatar,tt0499549,2009,7,"It's a great movie and there might even be nothing wrong with it. But there's also nothing special."
"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde",tt0022835,1931,9,"Dr. Jekyll is one of my earliest excursions into pre-Cold War cinema, and its emotional, dramatic performances have stayed with me all this time"
"Inherit the Wind",tt0053946,1960,10,"Through bias, neither side in this movie comes off as perfect. I love this film because we see the timeless battle between Liberal and Conservative. The men and women in this film experience pride and experience joy, a longing to hurt others and a longing to keep those around them safe, a desire to progress and a desire to hold to what they know is right despite the changing pressures. The performances are heartfelt; I can't help but tear up."
"Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb",tt0057012,1964,7,***
Shenandoah,tt0059711,1965,7,"It is the family dynamics of this film that pull it above a mediocre Western. Stewart does an excellent job as usual."
"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?",tt0061184,1966,10,"The first time I saw Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, I remember thinking to myself, ""What is this?"" But not like that—not in a questioning or dismissive way. I asked because I could not understand how I felt so close to the characters. I had never experienced that sensation—at least not outside of my books, not in the form of real people saying their lines on a screen in front of me. Now, many years removed from that first viewing, I am inclined to write-off my reaction to my unfamiliarity with cinema's canon. But I believe I would be wrong to do that. Surely, it is due, in part, to the original playwright, Edward Albee, but I think this movie captures its audience with the reality of it all. The characters seem real, and the dialogue does too. The events and the stories are all too familiar. The tragedy of life is laid out before us, and we cannot help but weep for it."
"The Graduate",tt0061722,1967,8,"The existentialist nature of the movie is a little off-putting, but the mood of the movie is uncannily effective."
"2001: A Space Odyssey",tt0062622,1968,10,"This film is, I believe, Kubrick's magnum opus; it is—in the truest sense of the word—a masterpiece that bends the audience's emotion like a conductor directing an orchestra."
"The Godfather",tt0068646,1972,10,"All of the artistic elements of filmmaking come together here and make an unmistakable masterpiece. It is an epic centered on a family, and the love and the cruelty therein."
"Taxi Driver",tt0075314,1976,8,"Taxi Driver is a horrifying look at the underbelly of 70s America and the damages of poor mental healthcare "
"Apocalypse Now",tt0078788,1979,7,***
"The Warriors",tt0080120,1979,7,***
"Raging Bull",tt0081398,1980,10,"Raging Bull is the greatest achievement of Frank Vincent, Joe Pesci, Robert De Niro, and Martin Scorsese, some of the greatest contributors to the film world. It is also, easily, one of the greatest movies ever. Raging Bull tells a story that defies genre, and does it in a most sobering way. De Niro's LaMotta can do nothing but evoke emotion from its audience, and for that, it may suffer among viewers. At times it may be too artsy, and at times it may be too gritty, but it is all for the greater effect. It is a masterpiece of cinema, that leaves you—the viewer—sympathizes for its victims. Never empathizing, though; how could you? There is little more to love in Jake ""the Bull"" LaMotta."
"Saludos Amigos",tt0036326,1942,5,"There’s little to endear it to a viewer."
"The Three Caballeros",tt0038166,1944,5,"This should not be an animated classic."
"Melody Time",tt0040580,1948,6,"It’s a little less cute and a little less fun than Make Mine Music."
"The Hairy Ape",tt0036892,1944,5,***
"The Black Cauldron",tt0088814,1985,8,"This forgotten gem glimmers on rare occasion with excellent artwork and darker themes. Check out Ebert’s review on this flick."
"Big Trouble in Little China",tt0090728,1986,8,"This movie is hilariously silly"
GoodFellas,tt0099685,1990,9,***
"Troll 2",tt0105643,1990,8,"Ratings break down for movies like this. But if we're giving it a score for how much I enjoy watching it with friends, then something high seems right."
"Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead",tt0100519,1990,7,***
"The Silence of the Lambs",tt0102926,1991,8,"Two villains, both sharing the spotlight, makes for a thrilling movie that leaves you on the edge."
"Pirates of Silicon Valley",tt0168122,1999,7,***
Ali,tt0248667,2001,7,"The boxing sequences are terrific and the storyline is nothing but interesting, but still, I was never quite captured by the movie."
"Love Actually",tt0314331,2003,6,"The movie is able to create a relationship and produce empathy for each of its characters despite the division of screen time among them—an impressive feat. Nonetheless, the movie falls into classic rom-com deficiencies and is appallingly materialistic/sexual."
"The Notebook",tt0332280,2004,6,"While the story of anyone with Alzheimer's is tragic, the movie is otherwise wheel-spinning"
"V for Vendetta",tt0434409,2005,8,"It's a college favorite"
"Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time",tt0473075,2010,6,***

"Robin Hood",tt0955308,2010,3,"There are mere minutes of entertaining action inside this mess"
Megamind,tt1001526,2010,8,"I'm a little tied on this vs. Shrek, but regardless, it is one of the funniest animated movies there is."
"Iron Man 2",tt1228705,2010,7,"This sequel captures little of its predecessor’s magic but does include a couple notable performances."
"True Grit",tt1403865,2010,6,"It advertised as a dark Western. It was not that at all. That's points off; why not just advertise it as the strong yet lighthearted Western that it is."
Tangled,tt0398286,2010,8,"Tangled has a lot of tangible goodness, including one notably creative scene, yet some of the gags and characters feel a little stock."
Inception,tt1375666,2010,8,"A great heist film with practical effects"
"How to Train Your Dragon",tt0892769,2010,7,"It's a good movie, but it's hard for me to fathom the huge following behind these movies"
Superbad,tt0829482,2007,6,"A somewhat revolutionary film for the comedy genre, launching a few careers. Pretty funny, but I think seeing it so late ruined it for me since it could not possibly live up to the hype it received."

"Black Swan",tt0947798,2010,7,***
"City of God",tt0317248,2002,10,"Cidade de Deus, on merit of story alone, struggles to stand with giants like Goodfellas and Gangs of New York. But simply because of the color and sound—the culture and love—emanating from the film, City of God can compete. For me, what is most stirring is merely seeing the cover/poster for the movie and remembering Rocket's boyish love and remembering what he lost."

"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix",tt0373889,2007,7,"Though I rated it the same as most of the others, the final dual is magnificent and undoubtedly one of the best scenes of the series."

"The Lincoln Lawyer",tt1189340,2011,7,***
"Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides",tt1298650,2011,4,"This movie represents the transition of a franchise from above-average and creative to bloated and cynical"

Zodiac,tt0443706,2007,8,***
"The Tree of Life",tt0478304,2011,8,"The message it delivers, I've heard before. And the beginning is so slow. But everything is made brand-new. From the cosmic to micro—through a family that conjures up my own memories—I am forced to acknowledge those mighty words God spoke to Job. Honestly, I was excited for the acting, the effects, the vistas, the 2001-like meditative pace, but it was the theme that took me."

"The Godfather: Part II",tt0071562,1974,10,"All of the artistic elements of filmmaking come together here and make an unmistakable masterpiece. It is an epic centered on a family, and the love and the cruelty therein."
"The Godfather: Part III",tt0099674,1990,8,"I'm tempted to rate this lower. I am torn on whether its association with the other two Godfather's helps or hurts it; I feel connected to Part III since I have gotten to know all the characters so well, but when compared to the other two, this movie definitely falls short. On its own, I think it deserves more than what it gets."

"Reservoir Dogs",tt0105236,1992,7,"A gritty Twelve Angry Men of sorts."
"Captain America: The First Avenger",tt0458339,2011,7,"Like Avengers: Age of Ultron, the first Captain movie is a divider, entering us into the greatest of the MCU, the ones that each accomplish something special. And Captain America: The First Avenger is special for delivering a romanticized hero, something audiences hadn’t seen since The Rocketeer or 1978’s Superman."
"Pulp Fiction",tt0110912,1994,8,"Pulp Fiction is a cultural touchstone and revolutionary film. It excels in narrative structure, lyrical writing, and the capturing of a milieu "

"Crazy, Stupid, Love.",tt1570728,2011,8,"A great romance, it has wonderful things to say about love and marriage. It's funny, but it's obvious that humor is not its main goal. This film is a great addition to the few believable rom-coms out there that say good things about traditional institutions."
"Super Troopers",tt0247745,2001,5,"Dumb but funny"

"The Avengers",tt0848228,2012,10,"Some have said The Avengers doesn’t hold up well. I say: Nonsense. The wit is perfect, the story streamlined. Each character is given their motivation and their story understands that motivation; all threads come together and everything is paid off. In addition to these fundamental virtues, though, The Avengers is a huge movie with huge importance. More than Iron Man, The Avengers showed what the MCU could be and continues to be. It is, in many regards, a perfect movie."
"No Country for Old Men",tt0477348,2007,10,"Though it makes me laugh on occasion, it is sadly nostalgic."
"There Will Be Blood",tt0469494,2007,9,"This is possibly Paul Thomas Anderson's strongest film with a fine performance by Daniel Day-Lewis. It stands alongside All About Eve and Citizen Kane as one of the great power corrupts stories."
"The Bourne Legacy",tt1194173,2012,5,"Action movie. It was thrilling at some points, but for the most part, just an action movie going through the formula."
"American Beauty",tt0169547,1999,10,"I greatly appreciate movies that can balance multiple genres at once, like this comedy meets tragic-drama. Its sad commentary on middle class life and complacency is piercing."
"The Cabin in the Woods",tt1259521,2012,8,"I hate horror movies, yet I loved this movie. Now, I admit, everything I dislike about horror movies, I disliked in this movie, but The Cabin in the Woods had so much more to offer. Funny and Scary? They said it couldn't be done, but apparently, they were wrong."
"The Amazing Spider-Man",tt0948470,2012,6,"Though correcting some of the previous franchise's errs, it lacks the emotional intelligence and film craftsmanship"
"The Maltese Falcon",tt0033870,1941,8,"The Maltese Falcon is a pinnacle noir film, more focused on the intrigue of the characters than that of its MacGuffin. "
"The Way of the Gun",tt0202677,2000,5,"There were some really fun parts in this movie, but the end slowed down rather than speeding up and the family dynamics remind me of the Bold and the Beautiful."
"The Beaver",tt1321860,2011,7,***
"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey",tt0903624,2012,7,"A really fun movie, but not much like Jackson's other films. And seriously, the FPS is like watching a soap opera."
"Mrs. Miniver",tt0035093,1942,5,***
"Les Miserables",tt1707386,2012,6,"Good—great source material obviously—but the camera man should take a few steps back."
Lincoln,tt0443272,2012,8,"The ""Inspirational"" film seems contrived and gimmicky but is nonetheless wonderful. The screenwriting and Day-Lewis's performance are particularly good."
"The Dark Knight Rises",tt1345836,2012,7,"Though correcting some directing issues from the previous two, this film still feels less cohesive"
Skyfall,tt1074638,2012,8,"It borrows a lot from the Bourne, Batman, and Die Hard series, but in so doing, it creates its own masterpiece. The balance (and resurrection) of the campier Bond films is a pleasant addition to the Craig era."
Unforgiven,tt0105695,1992,9,"Maybe I am too generous with this movie, but Unforgiven is one of the reasons I love the Western genre. Both a commentary on the genre and violence, this is a masterpiece film with funny, sad, and thrilling moments all."
"A Clockwork Orange",tt0066921,1971,7,"The soundtrack and sound-effects are some of the best, and the themes tossed around will not soon leave your mind. But, I would never advise someone to watch this movie—it is vulgar and grotesque. Also, though I do not think it ultimately achieves this, it comes dangerously close to celebrating wickedness through irresponsible directing"
"A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies",tt0112120,1995,7,"A very atypical look at the history of cinema. It could definitely be boring at times with a near 4 hour length, but I learned a lot."

"The Passion of Joan of Arc",tt0019254,1928,7,"As a modern viewer, it's hard to get past some of the techniques and methods used in this movie. But regardless—largely thanks to the score—it is a powerful story that makes you care."
"Visions of Light",tt0105764,1993,8,"Visions of Light is an intriguing look at the art of cinematography"
"The Quiet Man",tt0045061,1952,7,"A solid, if not mild, film"

"Singin' in the Rain",tt0045152,1952,9,"This movie truly is a classic in every sense. It has a little depth parallel to the story, but mainly it's just fun—clever, funny, aesthetically rich, and entertaining."
"The Sting",tt0070735,1973,8,"Stylish, funny, and thrilling, The Sting is the <i>true</i> inspiration for one of my personal favorites, Ocean's Eleven."
"The Tingler",tt0053363,1959,6,"It's a fun horror flick, but I expected a few more laughs or a few more scares than I got."
"The Outlaw Josey Wales",tt0075029,1976,9,"This is an important part of why I like Westerns: their ""revisionist"" history."

"Dallas Buyers Club",tt0790636,2013,7,"Artsy, well-acted, and deep (having 3 major themes with roughly the same amount of screen-time), Dallas Buyers Club has all the aspects of a good movie. It is not quite as entertaining as other movies with similar themes (e.g. Wolf of Wall Street), and it seemed to run through the motions at times, not adding anything new."

"Iron Man 3",tt1300854,2013,7,"Paralleled by only a few other movies on this list, Iron Man 3 demonstrates what it means to understand your own characters.

8½,tt0056801,1963,8,"A sort of cinematic ""Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,"" I started off disliking it—much like I did that book. But then after enough exposure, I had entered Guido's mind and Fellini's mind. And I understood it and empathized with it."
"The Great Gatsby",tt1343092,2013,6,"Though the novel isn't my favorite, this movie—while fine—fails to capture its source material's virtue"
"The Last Emperor",tt0093389,1987,7,"Creative in its use of color, The Last Emperor explores a trying time through the eyes of an important figure"

Chinatown,tt0071315,1974,9,"An elegant reentry to Noir. The Title is what makes this movie."

"Man of Steel",tt0770828,2013,7,"The movie has definite short-comings (lack of change, dismissal conclusion, excessive violence) but is still a passable superhero film."

50/50,tt1306980,2011,7,"You know who the best part of this movie is? Serge Houde. Hands down. 50/50 may not have the most profound message on the topic, but it handles it well and is very funny."
"World War Z",tt0816711,2013,8,"Plenty of tropes, without a doubt, but gripping and intense."

Bolt,tt0397892,2008,7,"It can be funny, but for the most part, the movie feels pretty generic."
Gravity,tt1454468,2013,8,"This movie reminds me of 2001, but not just because it's about Space. The movie, as has been pointed out already, is great not for its plot but for its visuals—because Cuaron knows where to place a camera. It reminds me of 2001, because it purposefully and masterfully directs my mind and my gut. Gravity is in complete control of how I feel, thrilling me the whole time."
Fargo,tt0116282,1996,10,"This is certainly my favorite from the extraordinarily talented Coen brothers. The seamless parallel of humor, commentary, and dark thrills is unequaled."

Shane,tt0046303,1953,9,"I do love a good Western, and this is one of the best."
"The Fountain",tt0414993,2006,7,"I think there are two problems that you can pin on this movie: not enough time is spent developing empathy for the characters, and the movie tries too hard—too much symbolism, motifs, connections, etc. I think Jackman's acting definitely starts to make up for the first, and the second isn't inherently bad. The Fountain tries to be artsy and ambiguous, but still stricken with hubris, tries to answer a big question. But that is all right, because I think it gives a good answer."
"Rise of the Planet of the Apes",tt1318514,2011,7,"The character of Caesar (as given to us by Andy Serkis) is magnificent and regal, setting this re-launch apart from the rest of franchise."

"The Wolf of Wall Street",tt0993846,2013,8,"I remember thinking during this movie, ""Is Scorsese pulling a Seinfeld here? Surely not..."" By the end of the film, I had settled on being appalled at the movie's decadence. But since then, someone has confirmed my earlier suspicions—Martin surely was pulling a Seinfeld: the movie is wicked and funny, and it is precisely our acceptance of that vulgarity that makes it wrong."
Dekalog,tt0092337,1989,10,"Greater than any of its technical achievements is its thematic word. The Decalogue reimagines what it means to live out God's revelation to humankind on Sinai, making it frighteningly closer to our hearts."
"Treasure Planet",tt0133240,2002,7,"The animation is pretty and the villain surprisingly complex, but the CGI has badly dated the movie."
"The Aristocats",tt0065421,1970,6,"Though notable for its influence on Pulp Fiction, this movie isn’t great. It has some fun parts, but you never really care about its characters."
"Chicken Little",tt0371606,2005,5,"The movie has heart and some solid jokes, but it tries too hard and the animation is lacking."
"Brother Bear",tt0328880,2003,5,"The movie suffers from an abundance of cliches; moreover, it montage-d its most important scene."
"Home on the Range",tt0299172,2004,5,"It has some surprisingly good cinematography and music, but the story is cliche and the main character uninteresting."
Frozen,tt2294629,2013,9,"Though its beginning is too rushed for effectiveness, Frozen is a beautiful, epic fairytale with excellent music and sweet storytelling."

Cube,tt0123755,1997,6,"Neat ideas and visually elegant, but poorly executed."
"My Dinner with Andre",tt0082783,1981,8,"The movie is boring and long, and though I hate the sort of people in it, My Dinner with Andre has worthwhile depth"
Noah,tt1959490,2014,8,"Since it took an obviously ludicrous approach to its depiction of Scripture, this biblical epic has received a lot of flack. But the movie is undoubtedly entertaining and boasts the intimacy and psychological-depth that Aronofsky is known for."
Alien,tt0078748,1979,8,"Obviously the symbolism is dense, and that makes for an interesting movie. But I found the best part of the movie to be the acting and special effects—both aspects that made the movie ""beautiful"" in its own way."
Carrie,tt0074285,1976,8,***
"X-Men: Days of Future Past",tt1877832,2014,9,"This movie took everything good from the X-Men franchise and put in one place. I've come to very much appreciate Michael Fassbender, and the Quicksilver scene was remarkable."

"Sleepy Hollow",tt0162661,1999,5,***
"Big Hero 6",tt2245084,2014,7,"Though it is beautifully animated with an exciting second half, its pacing is too quick and it feels like it's just hitting the beats."
"Transformers: Age of Extinction",tt2109248,2014,4,"There were more cliches than normal in this one, and it didn't even do a good job with the one element that I have consistently liked in the other movies: empathy and awe for Optimus Prime."

"How to Train Your Dragon 2",tt1646971,2014,7,***
"Warm Bodies",tt1588173,2013,8,"A beautiful blend of three different genres, Warm Bodies is one of the best movies I have seen in a while. It acted as a powerful metaphor, but as to what, I still have a couple choices in my head to choose from."
Metropolis,tt0017136,1927,8,"This movie took me a long time to get through, largely because of (despite its beauty) how slow the beginning 45 minutes were. But when it got going, it kept me enticed nearly as much as any modern-era flick. And regardless, the score, arrangement, and grandeur make Metropolis truly the most ""magnificent"" film I've ever seen."
"True Grit",tt0065126,1969,7,***
"Heaven is for Real",tt1929263,2014,4,"There are a lot of shortcomings in this movie, but there's so much more that could have gone wrong that the makers tactfully avoided."
"Before Sunrise",tt0112471,1995,8,"This movie is a more entertaining version of My Dinner with Andre. It is innovative, wise, and perhaps noble."
"Before Sunset",tt0381681,2004,9,"Better, I think. Sunrise has novelty, freshness, format all to its benefit. And Sunset has those same elements too, but it has something more. The romance matters more here. The story is more about these two than about their heady ideas. There is something uncannily magnetic about this film and its older sister, something that makes them special and not quickly forgettable."
"Guardians of the Galaxy",tt2015381,2014,9,"This film took the irreverent hilarity of The Avengers and amplified it a hundredfold, maintaining still its action-packed suspense and occasionally moving scenes."
"Good Morning, Vietnam",tt0093105,1987,8,"This is coming just days after the death of Williams, but even with such nostalgia aside, this movie's greatness is completely wrapped up in the performance of the late comedian. There a couple of compelling scenes in the movie and there is no lack of heart, but this film was certainly written to brandish the skills of Robin Williams."

"Red Dawn",tt0087985,1984,6,***
"Mad Max",tt0079501,1979,10,"By the artful direction of George Miller, these films each stand as thriller-masterpieces with practical stunts and action to immerse their viewers."
"Captain America: The Winter Soldier",tt1843866,2014,8,"Like Ant-Man, The Winter Soldier explored a new genre for the Marvel franchise. As an action-oriented spy-thriller, this movie works as a fast-paced genre-blending blockbuster. Its choreographed fight scenes stand out as some of the best in the business."
"The Road Warrior",tt0082694,1981,9,"By the artful direction of George Miller, these films each stand as thriller-masterpieces with practical stunts and action to immerse their viewers. Mad Max 2 demonstrates the perfect balance of visceral, gritty action and Miller's apocalyptic vision."
"Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome",tt0089530,1985,7,"By the artful direction of George Miller, these films each stand as thriller-masterpieces with practical stunts and action to immerse their viewers."
"The Usual Suspects",tt0114814,1995,8,***
Contagion,tt1598778,2011,8,"The characters here are secondary to the movie's true vision: the fear and terror of disease."
"Die Hard",tt0095016,1988,9,"This is one of the best action-thrillers I know. The element that sets it apart from all the rest is its main character: John McClane—and everything that is completely average about him."
Traffic,tt0181865,2000,8,"This one of the most blatantly meaningful movies I've seen in a long time. It establishes that its message is something of worth through the screen play and through the artistic editing and use of sound. I highly recommend it."
"12 Years a Slave",tt2024544,2013,8,"This adds another moving film to its specific genre."
"The Evil Dead",tt0083907,1981,7,***
"Evil Dead II",tt0092991,1987,8,"While it is not as scary, this movie demonstrates more what was intended in the first—a fun action movie."
Tootsie,tt0084805,1982,8,"Tootsie made me laugh the entire time—and it managed to have something valuable to say."

Shutter,tt0440803,2004,6,***
"Gangs of New York",tt0217505,2002,9,"This epic has much to say about unity and race politics, yet its greatest virtue is found in its performances and its exaggerated thrills."
Interstellar,tt0816692,2014,9,"Sitting on the edge of my seat, I could not help but wonder how Nolan had stolen all of my childhood dreams. His newest film, Interstellar, has finally brought to the big-screen everything I had hoped for and imagined about space in my younger years—it did this with added creativity and suspense. The movie is certainly one of the best movies I have seen this year, adding to Nolan's tasteful commentary on ethical systems and giving us McConaughey's best performance to date. Furthermore, I cannot help but respect the film's tributes to 2001 and how Nolan works within that legacy. With the exception of the last 3 minutes, I admit that I found most of the last third to be a bore and inconsequential to the movie's grandeur. Still, Nolan has done something fantastic here."
"The General",tt0017925,1926,9,"I'm tempted to give it a 10, given its timely handicap. I laughed out loud multiple times and was continuously impressed by the stunts and camera. In my opinion, this outshines any Chaplin film, and is one of the best film-history has to offer."
"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1",tt1951265,2014,7,***
Serendipity,tt0240890,2001,6,"Cute and funny at times. The themes it puts forward, though, are obnoxious."
"On the Waterfront",tt0047296,1954,10,"No one is cooler or smoother than Marlon Brando's Terry Malloy, but you cannot help but weep for the poor fool. He's found his safe niche in a corrupt system, and people even toss him the occasional favor. Yet he can't get comfortable thanks to the lovely Eva Saint. We watch as Terry and the others on the waterfront march upward and onward, escaping the life of a D&D bum. Along the march, Kazan and Schulberg give us some unforgettable shots and lines, and remind us of how things still have to change."
Brave,tt1217209,2012,7,***
"Gone Girl",tt2267998,2014,9,"Gone Girl is an exceptionally dark comedy. It is also incredibly suspenseful—in fact, watching it was the most stressful activity I've been a part of in a long time.  "
"The Swimmer",tt0063663,1968,8,"It's a tragic dream about one man's delusion."
"Dirty Dancing",tt0092890,1987,7,"The romance is believable, but the themes are despicable."
Selma,tt1020072,2014,8,"The best parts of this movie are a couple slow-motion scenes which capture the cruelty of the era, LBJ who is both believable and sympathetic, and the speeches from Dr. King which capture the strongest asset of the Civil Right's leader. I appreciated the humanizing of King (and of Johnson), though I did not find it as tastefully done as in ""Lincoln."" I also did not feel that the movie fully capitalized on the timbre of MLK's voice."
"Searching for Bobby Fischer",tt0108065,1993,8,"It is one entry in a popular and predictable genre, but it is done tastefully. Its subject also seems more beautiful and regal than the others."
Boyhood,tt1065073,2014,7,"This movie reminds me of three others: the Truman Show, Before Sunrise, and Seven Up!—all of which were better than this one. Still, I enjoyed the coming-of-age story, relishing in the frequent scenes that captured mundane life in its grandeur and humor. While sometimes I thought the movie delved too far into existentialism than it could handle, the performances of Hawke and the other parents brought it due weight."
"Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)",tt2562232,2014,9,"While the casting is probably my favorite part of this movie (something I've never said before), I greatly enjoyed its artistic approach and profoundly stated message."
"The Grand Budapest Hotel",tt2278388,2014,8,"It maintains most of the vices of Anderson's previous films, but excels with more humor and potent themes than some."
"American Sniper",tt2179136,2014,7,"A. O. Scott—among others—has pointed out that Eastwood's American Sniper is a Western in War-time's clothing. I think it should be watched and respected as such. The movie is based on black-and-white convictions about violence, while still being able to acknowledge some of the heartache that comes with the territory (something Eastwood has made a career of). It never delves into politics and debate, but that was assumed. It is not his most noble work, nor his most thematic—but it is good."
"The LEGO Movie",tt1490017,2014,8,"This movie does a lot right and not much wrong. It is both funny and thoughtful.  "
"Fast & Furious",tt1013752,2009,5,***
"Midnight in Paris",tt1605783,2011,8,"Like Allen's other work, it is witty and has a little something to say."
"The Island",tt0399201,2005,6,***
"Life of Pi",tt0454876,2012,9,"At the time of writing this, I have not read the book, and I am afraid it may make me biased. That's because the *story* for this movie is incredible—moving, interesting, and profound. It is even greater than Lee's magnificent visual effects."
"Dan in Real Life",tt0480242,2007,6,"There are some sweet scenes, but also an overabundance of cliche. "
"The Amazing Spider-Man 2",tt1872181,2014,5,"The movie is entertaining, as Marc Webb and Sony assured us it would be, but it is lost. It is lost among a host of undeveloped characters, and—what is worse—it is lost in what it means to be Peter Parker and to teach Peter what it means to grow up."
Luther,tt0309820,2003,6,"I am particularly interested in the movie, but it tries to cover too much—not enough time is devoted to any character or arc."
"Thor: The Dark World",tt1981115,2013,7,"It doesn't add much to the superhero genre."
"The Agony and the Ecstasy",tt0058886,1965,8,"The movie starts out fair but steadily increases all the way up until the end. Its best scene involves Michelangelo and Pope Julius standing under the creation of man at night, discussing the true image of God."
"Avengers: Age of Ultron",tt2395427,2015,8,"The second Avengers movie marks a demarcation in the MCU between movies that are entertaining and good and movies that are excellent. Though Whedon’s directorial vision was surely compromised by the studio, his flair and care for the characters is clear. While one might point to the inconsequential villain as the movie's downfall, it’s only real vice is not living up to the hype."
"Don Jon",tt2229499,2013,8,"Though I don't agree with all the conclusions, Don Jon is a poignant film on an important topic."
"Pitch Perfect 2",tt2848292,2015,5,***
Whiplash,tt2582802,2014,8,"Whiplash is entertaining—the characters are dynamic and the music riveting. An alteration of a familiar genre, the story arc (Fletcher's manipulation of Neyman) is continuously interesting."
"Mad Max: Fury Road",tt1392190,2015,9,"This film is a strong addition to an already strong series. Technically flawless with a breakneck pace, Mad Max: Fury Road is one of those rare movies that is simply a treat to watch."
"The Last of the Mohicans",tt0104691,1992,8,"There are some really beautiful parts in this movie."
"Some Like It Hot",tt0053291,1959,8,"This was a genuinely funny movie that managed to be potently topical."
Tombstone,tt0108358,1993,8,"This movie stands on its star power and charisma "
"Jurassic World",tt0369610,2015,7,"This was a good movie. There wasn't as much character payoff as the first film (and it wasn't quite as suspenseful), but it was a fun movie experience and the ending was exciting."
"Wild Strawberries",tt0050986,1957,8,"This is an exceptionally sweet movie with valuable introspection. "
"The Fugitive",tt0106977,1993,9,"Without many explosions or choreographed fight scenes, The Fugitive is one of the most sophisticated thrillers I've seen in a long while."
"Inside Out",tt2096673,2015,9,"Taking on the universal dilemma—and gift—of growing up, Inside Out does what only the animated medium can. Through the parallel stories of adolescent girl Riley and the anthropomorphized emotions inside her head, we get a visual perspective on what it's like and how it feels to grow up. A large share of the success of this movie is due to, as I said, its medium as well as the writing and performances for the Emotions (namely Joy and Sadness) who are almost more human than their real world counterparts. This is, yet again, another well-crafted, hilarious, and poignant film from Pixar."
Up,tt1049413,2009,8,"Up is great movie, rightly praised for its opening and gently critiqued for its latter half"
"A Christmas Story",tt0085334,1983,8,***
Nightcrawler,tt2872718,2014,8,"It's not the funniest dark comedy, but it is certainly one of the creepiest. Nightcrawler's greatest trait is its soundtrack."
Capote,tt0379725,2005,8,***
"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly",tt0401383,2007,7,"Though not the most moving film of its genre, it is tasteful and keeps the heart engaged"
"Kill Bill: Vol. 1",tt0266697,2003,7,"It's very stylized and generally good."
"Kill Bill: Vol. 2",tt0378194,2004,8,"It's a little better than its predecessor, with less action but more interesting dialogue. "
Ant-Man,tt0478970,2015,7,"Especially funny and excelling in low-key thrills, Ant-Man is a welcome addition to the MCU."
Poltergeist,tt0084516,1982,8,"The family dynamic is better than any scare in the movie."
Charade,tt0056923,1963,8,"Funny while suspenseful"
"Bridget Jones's Diary",tt0243155,2001,5,"The relatability of Zellweger's character is refreshing, but her acting and the normality of the story will leave all but anglophiles feeling empty."
"Inequality for All",tt2215151,2013,8,"This humorous and colloquial explanation from a scholar on an important issue is much appreciated."
"Shakespeare in Love",tt0138097,1998,8,"I can't say that it goes far, far beyond the genre, but I can say that this is one of the best movie adaptations of shakespeare or his work."
Blackfish,tt2545118,2013,8,"Though a little heavy handed at times, Blackfish is a sincere and emotional documentary of a sad way we seek entertainment. "
Witness,tt0090329,1985,8,"This is a solid movie, well-acted and suspenseful. As a student of religion, I am skeptical of the film's critique of the amish sect, but it is generally an excellent movie."
"The Gift",tt4178092,2015,7,"A few too many jump-scares, but a tactful and topically-balanced movie"
"The Human Experiment ",tt1802529,2013,6,"It says good things, but it is a little cliche and a little heavy-handed at times."
"Burn after Reading",tt0887883,2008,8,"Funny and suspenseful"
"Hot Fuzz",tt0425112,2007,9,"Hot Fuzz's genre-blending is what made me fall in love with the wit and skill of Edgar Wright"
Doubt,tt0918927,2008,8,"The movie is well-titled, acting as both a good mystery film as well as religious commentary."
"Black Mass",tt1355683,2015,7,"Despite its good performances, the movie doesn't stand out and has a little much going on at times."
"The Martian",tt3659388,2015,7,"Despite a few cliches and the assuredness of Murphy's Law, this was a funny, intense, heart-warming film."
Spectre,tt2379713,2015,7,"Despite some tonally strange moments and an underwhelming presence from Waltz, Spectre benefits from a strong female performance and some fun/impressive scenes."
"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2",tt1951266,2015,8,"(Having not seen the first one) This is my favorite in the series."
"The Kid",tt0219854,2000,6,***
"Star Wars: The Force Awakens",tt2488496,2015,9,"There's no doubt that this movie borrows a lot from its predecessors, but I think the widespread love for this blockbuster flick is a reflection of its impressive new characters and its fun and engaging tone."
Focus,tt2381941,2015,6,"Robbie is hard to watch and some of the twists aren't set up, but it's a generally fun movie"
"The Big Short",tt1596363,2015,9,"It borrows a lot stylistically from Wolf of Wall Street, but manages a feel of its own. It's funny, emotional, creative, and—most of all-important."
Joy,tt2446980,2015,6,"There's a lot of character-motivation confusion and tonal issues, but the performances are strong."
Brooklyn,tt2381111,2015,8,"Where it lacks in novelty, this period romance makes up in sweetness and charm."
Cinderella,tt1661199,2015,7,"This movie does a great job sidestepping cliches and is even able to move the audience at times."
"The Witch",tt4263482,2015,8,"Not terribly scary, but especially stylistic, eerie, and even beautiful."
"Bridge of Spies",tt3682448,2015,8,"An entirely Spielbergian film (and great in all the ways that implies)"
Laura,tt0037008,1944,8,***
Wings,tt0018578,1927,8,"The movie turned out to be much richer than I expected it to be."
"The Revenant ",tt1663202,2015,8,"Though not a pinnacle of empathy or profound depth and at times hard to watch, The Revenant is both a riveting and dazzling film."
Amadeus,tt0086879,1984,9,"Fun, though a tragedy, Amadeus is an unexpectedly acute look into the human psyche."
Spotlight,tt1895587,2015,8,"This is an important and intriguing news story. It achieves some emotion with Michael Creighton's character, but you will have to wait until the end for the true impact of the film."
"The Grapes of Wrath",tt0032551,1940,10,"Though a little more political than its source material, the universal truths and the empathy it inspires rings louder than ever in this 1940 masterpiece."
Room,tt3170832,2015,8,"The movie advances beyond a neat concept or teenage-esque, agony-absorbed film, and becomes genuinely heartwarming."
"The Lost City of Z",tt1212428,2016,7,"The movie is beautiful and nostalgic, and the costume-design is oscar-worthy. However, the film is thematically jumbled at best and perhaps even malevolent."
"Hail, Caesar!",tt0475290,2016,8,"Hail, Caesar! is a poignant critique as well as loving demonstration of the art of Hollywood."
"Ex Machina",tt0470752,2014,8,"Ex Machina is a slow and eerie think piece (dealing with a range of topics including god-complexes, the meaning of life, information ethics, and feminism) that will leave you pondering the film's meaning long after it's over."
Trumbo,tt3203606,2015,7,"Cranston is the best part of this otherwise average film."
Zootopia,tt2948356,2016,8,"This funny, sweet mystery film is both topically meaningful and beautifully animated."
"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice",tt2975590,2016,5,"Though it contains one fun scene and is occasionally pleasant to look at, Batman v Superman is convoluted, character-lacking mess."
"The Broadway Melody",tt0019729,1929,3,***
Clueless,tt0112697,1995,7,***
Big,tt0094737,1988,9,"An incredibly sweet and fun coming of age story that places characters and truths over gags."
"The Jungle Book",tt3040964,2016,8,"The Jungle Book is, while not emotionally noteworthy, visually stunning and exciting to watch. The scene with King Louie is a real treat."
"All Quiet on the Western Front",tt0020629,1930,9,"Emotionally full and visually engaging—remarkably so for its time"
"Midnight Special",tt2649554,2016,8,"The movie is emotionally resonant and completely suspenseful and entertaining, though as you would expect with a genre like this and the build-up this movie has, the ending falls short of the rest."
"Captain America: Civil War",tt3498820,2016,9,"Civil War is Marvel’s Empire Strikes Back (at least before Infinity War came out). It is the low point of the series (emotionally; quality-wise its the highpoint) with the dramatic events that shape the franchise. While maintaining the MCU’s signature snark, it manages a darker tone with intimate interactions for its main protagonists. The Russo brothers bring the well structured narrative and choreographed fights of their first endeavor, The Winter Soldier, to Civil War as well as an openness to the entire Marvel Universe. Perhaps, Civil War’s one weakness is that the stakes are watered down in the last five minutes of the movie to make it more palpable for audiences."
"Daddy's Home",tt1528854,2015,5,"It's a mostly cliche movie with some occasional wit and charisma from its stars."
"The Nice Guys",tt3799694,2016,9,"Though I wouldn't recommend it for younger audiences, this is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a while with two perfectly crafted characters. "
"Love & Friendship",tt3068194,2016,8,"Love and Friendship, while not as sweet as its other Jane Austen counterparts, is the funniest and most stylish of the lot. Also, its satirical approach to romance in Gregorian society is a welcome surprise. "
"Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping",tt3960412,2016,7,"Pretty funny, but also pretty repetitive."
"The Boondock Saints",tt0144117,1999,3,"This is the worst of college-favorites—overly stylized without much substance"
"Finding Dory",tt2277860,2016,8,"Though I did not find it as resonate as its predecessor, Finding Dory has all the depth, humor, and charm we've come to expect from Pixar."
"Something's Gotta Give",tt0337741,2003,5,***
"The Magnificent Seven",tt0054047,1960,9,"The gun battles are fun, the personal stories are generally poignant, and the music is sweeping—all together, it makes for an amazing Western."
"Star Trek: Beyond",tt2660888,2016,8,"More ""sci-fi"" and more Simon Pegg makes for an excellent third installment to the Star Trek trilogy."
"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington",tt0031679,1939,8,"While on a technical level it is clearly still early in the history of filmmaking and it's also dabbles in plenty of the typical Hollywood sap and patriotism, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington—in its last minutes—demonstrates that Capra's classic can be original, challenging, and heartfelt."
"Hell or High Water",tt2582782,2016,9,"Hell or Highwater is a remarkably simple film with grand intent. The movie is set in expansive West Texas—a character of the film in its own right—and near the beginning the idea is presented that the dry, dusty land before us once belonged to the Comanche until the white people took it from them; then it belonged to the white people until the banks took it away from them. This idea of property and justice follows our main characters the entire length of the film as the travel all over the forsaken landscape. Hell or Highwater, through each of its four main characters, provides a human portrait, skinned down until the truth of desperation, loyalty, purpose, pride, and especially justice are all laid bare. It is another installment for Neo-Westerns and deals with the common anti-Wall Street themes in many recent movies, yet it transcends as an intimate glance at the lives of those pushed to the edge. In all, the movie is humorous, thrilling, and elegiac."
"The Birth of a Nation",tt0004972,1915,7,"The technical influence of of this movie is clear—it is one of the most visually interesting silent films I have ever seen. The racism of the movie cannot be overstated, however. It is not simply racist for modern, liberal tastes, but it is objectively offensive for even the most conservative today."
Romero,tt0098219,1989,7,"Not so much a meditation on liberation theology as an attempted inspirational biopic, pitting poverty against politics. Its technical quality limits its effectiveness. "
Stagecoach,tt0031971,1939,9,"Stagecoach is a remarkable film with clearly defined characters, an intense yet simple plot, and engaging, practical effects."
"Requiem for a Dream",tt0180093,2000,10,"Requiem for a Dream holds the psychological depth expected of an Aronofsky work, but unlike other films I've seen of his, this one feels empathetic and hopeful. During the Summer chapter of the movie, we truly believe that the characters may have a future, but come Winter, all hope is lost in one of the most effectively depressing and sobering scenes in all of cinema. Requiem, while not the most adult movie I've seen, is certainly inappropriate for younger audiences—yet, that is not the reason I might hesitate to recommend it. The ending is truly unsettling and saddening, and left me in a state of introspection and loneliness."
"El Topo",tt0067866,1970,6,"It's stylish and interesting, with some parts worth reflecting on, but the lack of narrative ends up dismantling this movie."
"Southside With You",tt4258698,2016,5,"My bias in favor of the presidential couple could not save this movie from date-movie cliches, some awkward writing near the beginning, and a focus on character backstories rather than characters. "
"Repo! The Genetic Opera",tt0963194,2008,5,"The overall premise is interesting and the camp is done almost perfectly, but the movie is a technical mess (and not within my personal realm of taste)."
"Shaun of the Dead",tt0365748,2004,8,***
"The Country Bears",tt0276033,2002,5,***
Superman,tt0078346,1978,8,"This movie perfectly captures the character and mythos of Superman—a feat that has not been accomplished since. If it weren't for the last act, this movie would easily stand in the top 3 superhero films to date."
"The World's End",tt1213663,2013,8,"The movie's twist halfway through works really well, and the comedy from the acting/directing team is excellent as always—but overall, it is their third best from the Trilogy."
"The Little Prince",tt1754656,2015,8,"A lot is covered in this short movie—but its best parts come from its faithful adaption of the source material. "
Sully,tt3263904,2016,6,"While heartwarming, Sully's cliches keep it as a middling effort by its all-star team."
"The Girl on the Train",tt3631112,2016,6,"It's hard not compare this movie to Gone Girl, which it is not remotely as good as partly due to its soap opera-esque plot, but the last third becomes genuinely thrilling. "
"The Birth of a Nation",tt4196450,2016,8,"The Birth of a Nation stands alongside Do the Right Thing as one of the best racial critiques in cinema. Capturing the righteous indignation of an era and employing a not-so-subtle allusion to our nation/Hollywood's history through its title, Nate Parker's directing debut is not a flawless one but a potent one."
"Doctor Strange",tt1211837,2016,8,"My rating for this movie is bolstered purely on the finale and the scene where Strange is introduced to the world of magic because of the much needed creativity they represent."
Halloween,tt0077651,1978,7,***
Arrival,tt2543164,2016,9,"Arrival works as a Sci-Fi flick should. It lifts its almost cliche theme to greater heights by merit of its earned and subtle writing."
"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them",tt3183660,2016,6,"Colin Farrell and the aesthetic of the movie barely make up for an overabundance of CGI, a convoluted plot, and an obnoxious—though handsome—star. "
Moana,tt3521164,2016,8,"Though I loved Zootopia, Moana takes the award for the year's best animated feature. While it may not manage anything novel in terms of message, the pacific islander flick is breathtakingly beautiful and provides excellent additions to the pantheon of Disney music. "
Cimarron,tt0021746,1931,5,***
"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story",tt3748528,2016,7,"The last act and the fan-fare Vader scene are excellent, but as a whole, the movie is flat and poorly-paced and the characters are unlikable."
"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid",tt0064115,1969,7,***
"Sausage Party",tt1700841,2016,5,***
"A Christmas Carol",tt0044008,1951,7,***
"Malcolm X",tt0104797,1992,8,"Malcolm X works best as a stage for its star and an explanation for its hero. It is not as sweeping as other biopics of its time or as piercing as other Lee efforts, but nonetheless, it is sweeping and it is piercing."
"La La Land",tt3783958,2016,8,"Though its final act/scenes make it hard to pinpoint the intentions of the film makers, La La Land is a fun, sweet, and inspiring flick."
Fences,tt2671706,2016,8,"Coming out the same year as Southside with You, Fences demonstrates how to best make a musing character study."
"The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!",tt0095705,1988,7,***
"Manchester by the Sea",tt4034228,2016,9,"This movie, both in direction and writing, is everything a dramatic film should seek to be."
Silence,tt0490215,2016,9,"Silence is a difficult movie to watch, not only on account of its torture scenes but also for the piercing critique of faith that it delivers. There are some semblances of hope, namely the faith of its Director, but it is a movie that will stay with you and challenge you for days afterward."
Moonlight,tt4975722,2016,8,"Moonlight delivers a slow, saddening portrayal of the marginalized and those left confused in their search for identity."
"The Lobster",tt3464902,2015,8,***
"Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging",tt0963743,2008,6,"If we divide it into a four-act structure, the movie was excellent during the third act, delivering a nuanced and unexpected take on teenage life with a fair amount of humor. But the final act sinks back into cliche."
"Phantom Thread",tt5776858,2017,7,***
"The LEGO Batman Movie",tt4116284,2017,9,"Even more than its predecessor, The LEGO Batman movie balances wit, humor, thematic import, economic storytelling, and dazzling aesthetics to make for a great film."
"Get Out",tt5052448,2017,9,"I'm a sucker for genre blending, and Peele's first effort as a director does not disappoint. It delivers with both laughs and thrills and is hopefully a representative of a great start for a long career."
Logan,tt3315342,2017,9,"Logan is a heartfelt entry into comicbook movies, an excellent performance by Jackman, and a melancholy sendoff to some beloved heroes."
"Beauty and the Beast",tt2771200,2017,6,"I could maybe be convinced of a 7, but the 2017 remake adds little to the original, a not-so-old classic. The Beast's song and a few details here and there, while good, hardly warrant a live-action adaptation."
Sicario,tt3397884,2015,8,"Unlike other films, Sicario, in addition to its thrilling set-pieces, does begin to stretch your ideas on right and wrong."
"The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse",tt0012190,1921,5,***
"21 Jump Street",tt1232829,2012,8,***
Munich,tt0408306,2005,9,"People have a hard time with this movie because they have a hard time understanding it as a Spielberg film—or maybe that's not it, maybe they have a hard time with it because it seems too on the nose. And as far as it top layer goes, that may be fair—it's pretty overt about its Shakespearean claim that blood begets blood. But as you might expect from one of the smartest directors working today (and of all time), Munich has more than that. Munich is a film about sympathy with visceral hatred and overwhelming passion—understanding how not everyone is wrong but rather, as Ebert points out, everyone is right."
"Winnie the Pooh",tt1449283,2011,7,"It fails to capture the magic of its predecessor."
"Kubo and the Two Strings",tt4302938,2016,7,***
"Magic Mike",tt1915581,2012,8,***
"Tropic Thunder",tt0942385,2008,7,"The satire is excellent, the action not-half-bad, and the humor sparse."
Gremlins,tt0087363,1984,7,"This is a fun and charming movie with only a few scenes that do not age well."
Footloose,tt0087277,1984,6,"Thematically, I found the movie very disagreeable, but in terms of fun: it excels."
"Across the Universe",tt0445922,2007,6,***
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2",tt3896198,2017,9,"This sequel has all the action, visuals, and humor of its predecessor, and while it may not be as emotionally resonant, it sneaks in some true inventiveness."
"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World",tt0446029,2010,8,"Scott Pilgrim is notable for its edgar Wright-ian visuals, which always make for an interesting comedy viewing, but I think this film's script excels in its handling of teen/young adult dating."
"Wonder Woman",tt0451279,2017,7,"Check out my <a class='link' href='https://religionandstory.wordpress.com/2017/06/15/wonder-woman-perfectly-adequate/'>Blog's Review</a>"
Bridesmaids,tt1478338,2011,8,***
"Sing Street",tt3544112,2016,7,"Sing Street is a likable, charming movie even if it is a little uneven at times."
"Baby Driver",tt3890160,2017,9,"Baby Driver is a fun, slick movie, demonstrating how to make a movie with style."
"Spider-Man: Homecoming",tt2250912,2017,8,"Not as good as the Maguire movies but better than Garfield—Spider-man suffers from uneven directing and inconsistent powers but greatly excels in its first and final acts, blending with the MCU, lead performances, and high school themes."
"Glengarry Glen Ross",tt0104348,1992,8,"It has the heart and wit of a play and the elegance only film can bring."
"The Iron Horse",tt0015016,1924,7,"As far as silent movies go, this epic Western is something special. The action is clean and understandable while still having an element of realism; the characters are mostly charming and there is humor that translates to modern viewers."
"Superman II",tt0081573,1980,7,"The movie is charming and fun, but not as grand and sincere as the first one"
"King Kong",tt0024216,1933,8,"The movie is filled with iconic and memorable scenes, a textured story, and great effects "
Eraserhead,tt0074486,1977,6,"This is my first Lynch film, and while I appreciate the avant-garde (especially in light of the movie's release year) as well as the film's thematic build and use of sound, it still manages to be pretty boring"
Heat,tt0113277,1995,7,"It's polished, has good acting, and is fairly thrilling—though a little melodramatic"
"In the Heat of the Night",tt0061811,1967,8,"Beyond its social commentary, In the Heat of the Night operates as a suspenseful murder mystery."
"Hoop Dreams",tt0110057,1994,8,"Following the lives of two Chicago boys with basketball promise, Hoop Dreams is one of the most intimate, eye-opening, and sobering documentaries I've seen."
"Dead Man Walking",tt0112818,1995,9,"The politics of this crime drama are lackluster, but its performances and heart are not to be outdone. "
Dunkirk,tt5013056,2017,7,***
"Grand Hotel",tt0022958,1932,6,***
"Close Encounters of the Third Kind",tt0075860,1977,8,"Uncharacteristic of Spielberg, this movie doesn't work on a timeless level so that it will appeal to modern audiences just as it did to its original audience. But if you take yourself back, Close Encounters offers a suspenseful, emotional, and awe-inspiring journey caught no where else on film."
"Logan Lucky",tt5439796,2017,9,"Though clearly reminiscent of Soderbergh's Oceans Trilogy, Logan Lucky could be copied from lesser movies. The heist comedy is heartfelt, warming, thrilling, and hilarious all in one."
Deadpool,tt1431045,2016,7,"This movie has some fairly good action and is pretty funny (especially considering I didn't watch it with an audience)."
"Sex, Lies, and Videotape",tt0098724,1989,9,"The characters and dialogue for this movie are superb. I think the most notable achievement of SLV is that it manages to both tackle an indie-intimate-drama scope while not venturing into film-student territory. "
mother!,tt5109784,2017,8,"Though flawed, mother! offers an allegorical, dream-like film to mass audiences, for which I wish them the best of luck."
"Blade Runner 2049",tt1856101,2017,8,"As beautifully shot and suspenseful as the original, Blade Runner makes for an intriguing movie—even if its storytelling goals are a little too lofty. "
"Shoulder Arms",tt0009611,1918,8,***
"Hellboy II: The Golden Army",tt0411477,2008,7,***
"In the Name of the Father",tt0107207,1993,7,"Though I cried, I was not moved"
"High Noon",tt0044706,1952,8,"I knew it was supposed to be good, but I was shocked by the craftsmanship and narrative propulsion of this black and white, 50s Western. There's a reason it stands as one of the best. It could have been a 9 if they hadn't had Amy shoot that dude"
"Easy Rider",tt0064276,1969,5,***
"Thor: Ragnarok",tt3501632,2017,8,"I could see this movie dropping in the rankings when the pure joy of watching it wears off. But for now, Thor: Ragnarok demonstrates a movie with growing characters, some visual humor, and possibly the funniest Marvel script to-date."
"The Big Sick",tt5462602,2017,8,***
"Justice League",tt0974015,2017,6,"The movie has its faults—tonally uneven, obnoxiously forgettable villain, and rushed storytelling—it manages to nonetheless be entertaining with major successes over previous DC installments."
Wonder,tt2543472,2017,7,***
"Murder on the Orient Express",tt3402236,2017,6,***
Trolls,tt1679335,2016,6,***
Mudbound,tt2396589,2017,7,***
"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes",tt2103281,2014,9,"Riveting and beautiful, the second Planet of the Apes film ups its already good predecessor with intelligence and intimacy. This movie seems to have everything going for it (besides the fact that Lauren refuses to see it)—it is a technological achievement, gorgeous in every frame, smart, narratively complex (at least for a summer flick), and human. I can't believe I missed out on this franchise for so long, but I'm glad I've seen it now—and I won't soon forget it."
"Lady Bird",tt4925292,2017,9,"Surprisingly humorous, Lady Bird is one of the most poignant and relatable coming-of-age stories in film history."
"War for the Planet of the Apes ",tt3450958,2017,9,"Though the film drags at times, it has the most beautiful scenes in either list and some of the most potent character interactions put to film."
"Star Wars: The Last Jedi",tt2527336,2017,9,"The Last Jedi is perhaps the most thematically resonant of all the Star Wars films. It manages this accolade alongside some genuine surprises, lovely cinematography, and impressive action. Though it is certainly flawed, it makes for a more interesting installment than The Force Awakens"
"The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)",tt5536736,2017,7,"The first half is better than the second; as a whole, it plays as an excellent character study."
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle",tt2283362,2017,6,"It's exactly what you'd expect."
"Barton Fink",tt0101410,1991,8,"Complex and intriguing as all Coen films are, I am destined to come back to this film and continuing trying to pry open its mysteries and layers."
Cavalcade,tt0023876,1933,5,***
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",tt5027774,2017,8,"Many movies have been made about the evils of revenge, but no movie has ever handled real, intimate, human revenge like Three Billboards—the kind of revenge that seeks to hate or love someone without fully knowing who they are. Our two main characters are intriguing and tragic, and you'll be tied up in their stories from minute one."
Primer,tt0390384,2004,8,"A rare movie that thrives on its complexity, Primer may have its issues, but it is undoubtedly fascinating."
"The Post",tt6294822,2017,8,"The first half, necessary to set up the second, can feel long at times. But the second half of the movie is engaging and at times beautiful. "
Hostiles,tt5478478,2017,8,"The narratively uneven, Hostiles is aesthetically and emotionally strong."
"The Shape of Water",tt5580390,2017,9,"Beautiful, whimsical, and classic, with a strong push of progressivism"
"The Haunting",tt0171363,1999,6,***
"Darkest Hour",tt4555426,2017,7,"Its cinematography and score make this dialogue-driven movie move with force"
"Hacksaw Ridge",tt2119532,2016,8,***
"Life Itself",tt2382298,2014,7,"The documentary is a documentary, but the life and beauty of its subject is unparalleled"
"Black Panther",tt1825683,2018,8,"Though it has its flaws, Black Panther stands as one of the best Marvel movies with an excellent villain, great music, and simply avoiding cliches. Also, its political statement is well-developed"
"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang",tt0373469,2005,8,"Funny and creative and thrilling, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang sets precedents for many of the blockbusters in the coming decade."
"Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox",tt2820466,2013,6,"Technically it's lacking. But the story is very engaging."
"Game Night",tt2704998,2018,7,"A solid and funny flick with real character work"
"Hidden Figures",tt4846340,2016,6,"A fine movie, not spectacular enough in any regard for an Oscar nomination"
Annihilation,tt2798920,2018,8,***
Jackie,tt1619029,2016,7,"The style of the movie—in its music, production design, and cinematography—is what makes it special."
Unsane,tt7153766,2018,7,***
"Edge of Tomorrow",tt1631867,2014,9,***
"A Quiet Place",tt6644200,2018,7,***
"Avengers: Infinity War",tt4154756,2018,9,"This movie is exactly what the MCU needed—a movie with all the spectacle and humor, but moving this unprecedented franchise in new directions."
"Lars and the Real Girl",tt0805564,2007,6,"The acting and the tone seem inconsistent, but the film ends up being genuinely heartwarming."
"Intolerance: Love's Struggle Throughout the Ages",tt0006864,1916,7,"It may be hard to sit through, but the spectacle of Griffith's romantic epic is breathtaking and astounding."
"Bonnie and Clyde",tt0061418,1967,10,"Sensual and thrilling, Bonnie and Clyde is a wonder of its time, not only historically significant in the world of film but enchanting in its own right. "
"Being John Malkovich",tt0120601,1999,7,"Kaufman delivers a characteristically interesting script, but the characters aren't strong enough to achieve his goal."
Sunrise,tt0018455,1927,7,"Sunrise is a well-crafted film ahead of its time"
"Deadpool 2",tt5463162,2018,8,"This movie could easily be knocked down a point because of its poor structure and slow start, but the humor and action manage to make for an excellent viewing experience."
"Mean Streets",tt0070379,1973,7,"Mean Streets paves an excellent introduction to the work of Martin Scorsese. "
"A.I. Artificial Intelligence",tt0212720,2001,8,"I'm still wrestling with the movie's meaning, but even without a final answer, I have the strong suspicion that this is one of the most intelligent, well-crafted films I have seen in a while."
"Solo: A Star Wars Story",tt3778644,2018,7,"Though the humor is lacking and the acting uneven, the propulsive plot is one of the best in the franchise and the movie is still admittedly good."
"In Bruges",tt0780536,2008,9,"In Bruges is affecting and darkly funny. I already anticipate coming back to it many times on account of its tight, meaningful script."
"Duck Soup",tt0023969,1933,6,"The humor is there, for old audiences and new, but the filmmaking is lacking."
Collateral,tt0369339,2004,9,"Collateral bears a lot of similarities to Mann's other work, but bolstered by the intimate scope and Cruise's always solid performance, this movie manages to stand above the rest."
Upgrade,tt6499752,2018,9,"Though not the first in any regard, Upgrade delivers a suspenseful, imaginative thriller with heavily stylized action."
"The Philadelphia Story",tt0032904,1940,8,"The Philadelphia Story is a seminal work for three Hollywood giants"
Nashville,tt0073440,1975,7,"Though distastefully cynical, Nashville stands as a deeply personal film."
Coco,tt2380307,2017,8,"Unique, emotional, and at times lovely, Coco is another Pixar hit"
"The Rocky Horror Picture Show",tt0073629,1975,5,"The movie is undoubtedly interesting, but with the exception of a few musical numbers, I found myself rarely entertained."
"Killing Them Softly",tt1764234,2012,8,"Well edited and suspenseful; an excellent low-key thriller"
"Wind River",tt5362988,2017,8,***
"Before Midnight",tt2209418,2013,8,"Though more ""plotty"" and pessimistic than its predecessors, Before Midnight is still an excellent movie"
"Double Indemnity",tt0036775,1944,9,***
RoboCop,tt0093870,1987,9,"This is my second Paul Verhoeven movie, and it's easy to recognize him as a master of the craft."
Snowpiercer,tt1706620,2013,8,"The world is creative and the action propulsive"
"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre",tt0040897,1948,9,***
Hereditary,tt7784604,2018,7,"Interesting and thematically resonant, Hereditary falls short simply for lack of scares"
"Captain Fantastic",tt3553976,2016,7,***
"A Streetcar Named Desire",tt0044081,1951,9,"Launching one of the greatest careers in Hollywood history, A Streetcar Named Desire is almost the perfect melodrama."
"Jackie Brown",tt0119396,1997,8,***
"The Hateful Eight",tt3460252,2015,8,***
"Paths of Glory",tt0050825,1957,9,"Though one of his earliest, this is also one of Kubrick's best."
"Apollo 13",tt0112384,1995,8,"Apollo 13 is a solid, well-crafted movie."
Blindspotting,tt7242142,2018,9,"This is a movie of the times—humorous, mildly stylized, and political. And while the movie deals with the heavy topics of police brutality, race issues, and the problems of gentrification, its power is in its characters' arcs."
"Ant-Man and the Wasp",tt5095030,2018,7,"It's a strong movie as all Marvel films are, but it adds little new material and reaches its saturation point for plot holes and techno-babble."
"Mission: Impossible - Fallout",tt4912910,2018,9,"This is about as perfect an action movie as they come. It is thrilling and suspenseful throughout, the set-pieces are daring, the cinematography graceful, and the themes cogent (you can't ask for much more than that in an MI film)."
Selena,tt0120094,1997,7,"Where it lacks in technique (though there are some surprisingly interesting choices made) and narrative inventiveness, it makes up for it in heart and cultural import"
"The Informant!",tt1130080,2009,9,***
"The Meg",tt4779682,2018,5,"It can be fun at times, but it doesn't go far enough and campy enough."
"Last Days in the Desert",tt3513054,2015,7,"Last Days in the Desert is elegantly shot and boasts a strong performance and writing around its central character(s) played by Ewan McGregor, but other parts of the movie don't live up to those same standards and its thematic intent becomes muddled."
BlacKkKlansman,tt7349662,2018,8,"Funny and thrilling, BlackkKlansman succeeds as a movie. As political commentary, it is sometimes ambiguous but generally piercing. "
Paddington,tt1109624,2014,9,"Perfectly crafted in its simplicity"
Searching,tt7668870,2018,8,"It's suspenseful and it naturally incorporates its stylistic gimmick (for the most part)—and that's really all you can ask of these movies."
"To All the Boys I've Loved Before",tt3846674,2018,9,"A perfectly delightful and elegantly structured teen-drama flick"
"A Simple Favor",tt7040874,2018,6,"A Simple Favor can be funny and suspenseful at times, but it's confused about its genre leaving the audience even more confused"
Fracture,tt0488120,2007,7,"An effective mystery with some strong performances"
"Son of Man",tt0065017,1969,9,"Though technically lacking, no other depiction of Jesus is as rich and functional in its attempt to make the story come alive"
"The Last Temptation of Christ",tt0095497,1988,8,"An interesting take on this important figure, but ultimately lacking in cohesion and weight"
"The Passion of the Christ",tt0335345,2004,8,"Though some elements are over-the-top, the attention to detail and grandeur of the film are undeniable."
"Inside Llewyn Davis",tt2042568,2013,9,"Deeply melancholy and affecting, but simultaneously charming and witty"
"A Star Is Born",tt1517451,2018,8,"An effective melodrama, Cooper shows off his directing chops alongside those baby blue eyes, and we should expect to see more of Gaga in Hollywood projects."
"First Man",tt1213641,2018,8,"This is another excellent addition to Damien Chazelle's filmography. It stands alongside some of the other modern space exploration greats. It has the drama and period romance of Apollo 13 along with the kinetic suspense of Gravity. Probably its greatest asset is its sound design."
"Bad Times at the El Royale",tt6628394,2018,8,"While far from perfect, Bad Times is thoroughly entertaining with fun twists and turns along the way"
"The Exorcist",tt0070047,1973,8,"As with many movies of its age, it has lost some of its scare-factor, but the characters, filmmaking, and creativity remain fresh as ever."
"Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald",tt4123430,2018,6,"This movie suffers from many of the same vices as the first--the magic is too easy, common, and digitally animated, the plot is too convoluted, and some of the characters are obnoxious--yet anytime Jude Law graces the screen, the movie excels, the final confrontation is suspenseful, and the world of the film is enchanting as always."
"Mutiny on the Bounty",tt0026752,1935,8,"Though Bligh's callousness is comical at times, the movie is technically and dramatically powerful"
"Green Book",tt6966692,2018,7,"The main characters are excellent and the movie is fun, but there is nothing extraordinarily novel to be found here"
Widows,tt4218572,2018,8,"Widows is an empowering, cathartic thriller with excellently written and performed characters"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse",tt4633694,2018,9,"With the possible exception of Sam Raimi's second installment, this is the best Spider-Man film to-date--and being the best Spider-Man film counts for a lot given the dramatic import of the property. This film boasts powerful backstories for several characters and two wonderfully architected arcs for its leads. And, of course, its style is breathtaking in its beauty and originality."
"The Greatest Showman",tt1485796,2017,6,"Though filled with cliches and stunted arcs, the music and performances are undeniably fun."
"White Christmas",tt0047673,1954,7,***
"The Ballad of Buster Scruggs",tt6412452,2018,8,"Though its nihilism is overwhelming and unwelcome, the flair and language of the characters is enchanting and each tale enthralling."
"Won't You Be My Neighbor?",tt7681902,2018,8,"Earnest and heartwarming"
