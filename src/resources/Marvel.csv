"The Avengers",tt0848228,2012,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2NTI1MTU4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODg0OTY0Nw@@._V1_SX300.jpg,"Surely you didn’t expect anything else to be number one? Some have said <i>The Avengers</i> doesn’t hold up well. I say: Nonsense. The wit is perfect, the story streamlined. Each character is given their motivation and their story understands that motivation; all threads come together and everything is paid off. In addition to these fundamental virtues, though, <i>The Avengers</i> is a huge movie with huge importance. More than <i>Iron Man</i>, <i>The Avengers</i> showed what the MCU could be and continues to be. It is, in many regards, a perfect movie."
"Captain America: Civil War",tt3498820,2016,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ0MTgyNjAxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjUzMDkyODE@._V1_SX300.jpg,"Civil War is Marvel’s <i>Empire Strikes Back</i> (at least before <i>Infinity War</i> came out). It is the low point of the series (emotionally; quality-wise its the highpoint) with the dramatic events that shape the franchise. While maintaining the MCU’s signature snark, it manages a darker tone with intimate interactions for its main protagonists. The Russo brothers bring the well structured narrative and choreographed fights of their first endeavor, <i>The Winter Soldier</i>, to <i>Civil War</i> as well as an openness to the entire Marvel Universe. Perhaps, <i>Civil War</i>’s one weakness is that the stakes are watered down in the last five minutes of the movie to make it more palpable for audiences."
"Iron Man",tt0371746,2008,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTczNTI2ODUwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTU0NTIzMw@@._V1_SX300.jpg,"It can be no surprise that the original Marvel movie cracks our top three. <i>Iron Man</i> is significantly more tame than the most recent franchise installments, and by its smaller scope, it delivers one of the most personal stories in the universe. The movie is also noteworthy purely for its cinematic influence, not only for establishing the summer tentpole genre for the next decade but also for demonstrating the power of casting."
"Avengers: Infinity War",tt4154756,2018,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjMxNjY2MDU1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzY1MTUwNTM@._V1_SX300.jpg,"This movie is exactly what the MCU needed—a movie with all the spectacle and humor, but moving this unprecedented franchise in new directions. While the film is certainly flawed, it is breathtaking in its achievement, both in the scope of the franchise and in cinema history."
"Captain America: The Winter Soldier",tt1843866,2014,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjM2NzUzNzQwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDQ1MDkwMTE@._V1_SX300.jpg,"Like <i>Ant-Man</i>, <i>The Winter Soldier</i> explored a new genre for the Marvel franchise. As an action-oriented spy-thriller, this movie works as a fast-paced genre-blending blockbuster. Its choreographed fight scenes stand out as some of the best in the business."
"Thor: Ragnarok",tt3501632,2017,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjMyNDkzMzI1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODcxODg5MjI@._V1_SX300.jpg,"I could see this movie dropping in the rankings when the pure joy of watching it wears off. But for now, <i>Thor: Ragnarok</i> demonstrates a movie with growing characters, some visual humor, and possibly the funniest Marvel script to-date."
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2",tt3896198,2017,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTg2MzI1MTg3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTU3NDA2MTI@._V1_SX300.jpg,"Though I stand in the minority here, I’ll contend that <i>Guardians 2</i> is the most clever and stylistically unique of all the MCU movies. This exceptionality is most evident in its visual gags, something unseen in Marvel movies at that point. Moreover, <i>Volume 2</i> needs to be praised for the emotional and thematic line of fatherhood that gets pulled through the entire narrative and actually results in the main characters’ growth."
"Guardians of the Galaxy",tt2015381,2014,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTAwMjU5OTgxNjZeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDUxNDYxODEx._V1_SX300.jpg,"The first and second Guardians movies are intelligent, funny, and—like <i>Doctor Strange</i>—visually interesting. They even have a level of depth to them as seen in the first movie by its emotional crux, Rocket Raccoon. (Yes, Rocket is the emotional center of the movie, even more than Quill and his mom)."
"Black Panther",tt1825683,2018,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1MTY2MjYzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTc4NTMwNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg,"<i>Black Panther</i> offers a creative new setting and a couple well-choreographed fight scenes. However, its greatest asset is its social slant joined with its commercial success, proving that audiences desire intelligent, worthwhile movies even during the summer."
"Captain America: The First Avenger",tt0458339,2011,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzOTc2NzU3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjY3MDE3NQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg,"Like <i>Avengers: Age of Ultron</i>, the first Captain movie is a divider, entering us into the greatest of the MCU, the ones that each accomplish something special. And <i>Captain America: The First Avenger</i> is special for delivering a romanticized hero, something audiences hadn’t seen since <i>The Rocketeer</i> or 1978’s <i>Superman</i>."
"Spider-Man: Homecoming",tt2250912,2017,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BNTk4ODQ1MzgzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTMyMzM4MTI@._V1_SX300.jpg,"So <i>Spider-Man: Homecoming</i> is a great film; that’s how it got in the top ten. The three best things it had going for it were (1) the jokes—which Marvel always excels at, (2) Peter feeling like a real high schooler, and (3) everything about Michael Keaton’s character. However, as mentioned, <i>Spider-Man</i> has one major issue: Peter doesn’t really learn anything. Just as with <i>The Amazing Spider-Man</i> series, Peter Parker is great and coasts on being right all the time. He is never wrong, never punished for the mistakes he makes. He is a natural at everything he does and saves the day for everyone, never learning to truly rely on anyone else. And that really limits how much you can care about a character."
"Iron Man 3",tt1300854,2013,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzMjEzMjY1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTMxOTYyOQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg,"Paralleled by only a few other movies on this list, <i>Iron Man 3</i> demonstrates what it means to understand your own characters. While it took some time to get over my fanboy rage regarding the Mandarin, I came around to appreciated Shane Black’s handling of Tony Stark and tangental structuring of the narrative."
"Doctor Strange",tt1211837,2016,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BNjgwNzAzNjk1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQ2NjI1OTE@._V1_SX300.jpg,"<i>Doctor Strange</i> is weird for me. It played with a lot of fun ideas and some really interesting visuals while maintaining the same style as the rest of the MCU. While I may have wanted it to go further, I liked what it did. I liked Strange’s initial psychedelic trip into the world of magic, and I liked the ending a lot. But <i>Doctor Strange</i> had the same problem a lot of Marvel movies have: no real growth. Blah, blah, I’m sure you disagree, but we’ll talk about it more with <i>Spider-Man</i>."
Ant-Man,tt0478970,2015,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjM2NTQ5Mzc2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTcxMDI2NTE@._V1_SX300.jpg,"A nice chaser after <i>Age of Ultron</i>, Ant-Man provided a new genre for Marvel to explore (the heist film) and some glimmers of dismissed writer and director Edgar Wright still shine through."
"Ant-Man and the Wasp",tt5095030,2018,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjcyYTk0N2YtMzc4ZC00Y2E0LWFkNDgtNjE1MzZmMGE1YjY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxODk2OTU@._V1_SX300.jpg,"It’s a strong movie as all Marvel films are, but it adds little new material and reaches its saturation point for plot holes and techno-babble."
Thor,tt0800369,2011,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BOGE4NzU1YTAtNzA3Mi00ZTA2LTg2YmYtMDJmMThiMjlkYjg2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTgzMDMzMTg@._V1_SX300.jpg,"<i>Thor</i>, like most of the movies in the Marvel’s first phase, comes loaded with humor and heart but lacks some of the special features of its peers."
"Avengers: Age of Ultron",tt2395427,2015,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4OGJmNWMtOTM4Ni00NTE3LTg3MDItZmQxYjc4N2JhNmUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTgzMDMzMTg@._V1_SX300.jpg,"The second Avengers movie marks a demarcation between movies that are entertaining and good and movies that are excellent. Though Whedon’s directorial vision was surely compromised by the studio, his flair and care for the characters is clear. It’s only real vice is not living up to the hype."
"The Incredible Hulk",tt0800080,2008,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyNzk3MjA1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTE1Njg2MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg,"It’s better than you remember."
"Iron Man 2",tt1228705,2010,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTM0MDgwNjMyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTg3NzAzMw@@._V1_SX300.jpg,"This sequel captures little of its predecessor’s magic but does include a couple notable performances."
"Thor: The Dark World",tt1981115,2013,https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyNzAwOTUxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTE0OTc5OQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg,"None of these movies are bad. This one’s just generic and bordering on boring."
